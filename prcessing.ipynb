Are these ﬁnancial \\nproducts really so, particularly those of exotic nature, or is it in fact people’s grasp and usage \\nof them that is the source of toxicity? While the use of derivatives increased in recent years at \\nastounding rates, the crash of 2008 has revealed that people’s understanding of them has not \\nrivalled their spread. Exotic Options and Hybrids covers a broad range of derivative structures \\nand focuses on the three main parts of a derivative’s life: the structuring of a product, its \\npricing and its hedging. By discussing these aspects in a practical, non-mathematical and \\nhighly intuitive setting, this book blasts the misunderstandings and the stigma, and stands \\nstrong as the only book in its class to make these exotic and complex concepts truly accessible. \\nWe base Exotic  Options and Hybrids on a realistic setting from the heart of the business: \\ninside a derivatives operation. Working from the assumption that one has a range of correctly \\nimplemented models, and the ability to trade a set of basic ﬁnancial instruments, a client’s \\nneed for a tailored ﬁnancial product then raises these questions: How does one structure this \\nproduct, correctly price it for the sale, and then hedge the resulting position until its maturity? \\nFollowing a risk-centred approach, Exotic Options and Hybrids is a well-written, thoroughly \\nresearched and consistently organized book that addresses these points in a down-to-earth \\nmanner. \\nThe book  contains  many examples involving time series and scenarios for different assets, \\nand while hypothetical, all are carefully designed so as to highlight interesting and signiﬁcant \\naspects of the business. Adoptions of real trades are examined in detail. To further illuminate \\npayoff structures, their introduction is accompanied by payoff diagrams, scenario analyses \\ninvolving ﬁgures and tables of paths, plus lifelike sample term sheets. By ﬁrst understanding \\nthe investor’s point of view, readers learn the methodology to structure a new payoff or modify \\nan existing one to give different exposures. The names of various products can sometimes \\nvary from one side of the industry to another, but those attributed to the products discussed in \\nthis book are commonly accepted to a great extent. Next, the reader learns how to spot where \\nthe risks lie to pave the way for sound valuation and hedging of the products. Models are \\nde-mystiﬁed in separately dedicated sections, but their implications are alluded to throughout \\nthe book in an intuitive and non-mathematical manner. \\nExotic Options  and  Hybrids is the ﬁrst book to offer insights into the structuring, pricing and \\ntrading of modern exotic and hybrid derivatives, without complicating matters with the use of \\nmaths. The applications, the strengths and the limitations of various models are highlighted, in \\nrelevance to the products and their risks, rather than the model implementations. Readers can xx Preface \\nthus understand how models work when applied to pricing and hedging, without getting lost in \\nthe mathematical dwellings that shape related texts. While previous texts are heavily technical, \\nothers do not offer enough exposure, if any, to the more advanced and modern structures. The \\nmultitude of structures covered in Exotic Options and Hybrids is quite comprehensive, and \\nencompasses many of the most up-to-date and promising products, including hybrid derivatives \\nand dynamic strategies. \\nThe book  is  formed of four parts, each containing related chapters which evolve in increasing \\ndegrees of complexity in the structures. Readers will be continuously stimulated by more \\nadvanced topics, and because of this breakdown the book can be read from front to back \\nwithout loss of interest. Alternatively, readers can jump straight to a speciﬁc chapter because \\nthe book is self-contained and references to earlier chapters and sections within the book are \\nexplicitly clear. Furthermore, movement between the various angles of analysis of a speciﬁc \\nproduct or concept is transparent, leaving readers free to focus on one aspect, or to read an \\nentire treatment of a subject. \\nThe ﬁrst tw o chapters lay the foundations and explain not only the basic blocks of derivatives \\nbut also the setup and people involved in the creation, pricing and hedging of exotic structures. \\nChapters 3 to 7 deﬁne vanilla options, the risks involved in trading them and the different \\ntools one can use to measure them. The second part of the book deals with the concept of \\ndispersion which is of key importance in the world of exotic options. Chapters 10 and 11 \\nfocus on barrier options and digitals that are very much used in the conception of structured \\nproducts. Chapters 13 to 16 constitute the third part of the book and present cliquets and related \\nstructures, mountain range options, and volatility derivatives, all of which are considered to \\nbe slightly more advanced exotic products. \\nAfter completing  the  discussion of exotic structures based upon equities, we move to hybrid \\nderivatives. These chapters allow us to draw on many of the points made earlier in the book \\nregarding correlation, dispersion and volatility, and provide a transparent insight into the world \\nof hybrid derivatives. The ﬁrst two of the four chapters on hybrids discuss the key asset classes: \\ninterest rates, commodities, foreign exchange, inﬂation and credit. For each asset class we look \\nat the markets individually and gain insight into the nature of each, the various underlyings, \\nvanilla instruments, skews and smiles and a brief look at some popular exotics in each. These \\nare followed by a chapter that discusses the structuring of hybrid derivatives and explains how \\nto construct meaningful combinations of the various asset classes. The last chapter on hybrids \\ndiscusses the pricing intricacies of these instruments, starting from each asset class and then \\nmodelling combinations thereof. Chapter 21, the ﬁnal chapter, deals with thematic indices and \\ndynamic strategies. These assets are very different from the traditional structured products \\npresented throughout the book, and constitute the new generation of advanced investment \\nsolutions. \\nWe strongly  belie ve that attentive readers of this book will learn many valuable insights in \\nto all facets of the business of structured products. Exotic Options and Hybrids appeals to all \\nthe parties involved in the creation, pricing and hedging of the simplest to the most complex \\nproducts. Once the heart of the business and its technical features are deeply assimilated, \\nreaders should be well equipped to contribute their own stone to the world of structured \\nproducts. Part I \\nFoundations 1 \\nBasic Instruments \\nConcentrate all your thoughts on the task at hand. The sun’s rays do not burn until brought to a \\nfocus. \\nAlexander Graham  Bell  \\n1.1 INTRODUCTION \\nWe begin the book by ﬁrst reviewing the basic set of ﬁnancial instruments. These are either \\nbuilding blocks of derivatives or impact their valuation. A derivative is a ﬁnancial instrument \\nderived from another asset. It can also be derived from a set of events, an index or some \\ncondition, and in all cases we refer to these as the underlying asset(s) of the derivative. The \\nset of ﬁnancial instruments discussed in this introductory chapter fall into two categories: they \\nare either exchange traded or over the counter . Exchange-traded products, also referred to as \\nlisted, are standardized products that are traded on an exchange which acts as the intermediary. \\nFutures contracts are an example of exchange-traded contracts. Over-the-counter products, on \\nthe other hand, are privately agreed directly between two parties, without the involvement of \\nan exchange. This includes almost all swaps and exotic derivatives. \\nWe ﬁrst look  at interest rates and explain the differences between the various types. These \\ninclude LIBOR, which is not only the most common ﬂoating rate used in swap agreements \\nbut also a reference rate that can be used to compute the present value of a future amount of \\nmoney. We also introduce the different discounting methods, which are of prime importance \\nin the valuation of derivatives. Within the topic of ﬁxed income, we deﬁne the essential debt \\ninstruments known as zero coupon bonds. \\nThis chapter  also  provides the basics of equity and currency markets. The features of \\nstocks are deﬁned as well as the parameters impacting their future price. We discuss how a \\ncurrency can be viewed as a stock asset; we then deﬁne the importance and uses of indices and \\nexchange-traded funds in trading strategies. Forward and futures contracts are also described \\nin this chapter. \\nTo round  out  the review of ﬁnancial instruments we discuss swaps, which are agreements that \\noccupy a central and crucial position in the over-the-counter market; the most commonly traded \\nswap being the interest rate swap. After deﬁning swaps’ features and trading purposes, we \\nintroduce cross-currency swaps that are used to transform a loan from one currency to another. \\nFinally, we present the features of total return swaps, which can replicate the performances of \\nassets such as equities or bonds. \\n1.2 INTEREST RATES \\nInterest rates represent the premium that has to be paid by a borrower to a lender. This amount \\nof money depends on the credit risk – that is, the risk of loss due to a debtor’s non-payment of \\nhis duty, on the interest and/or the principal, to the lender as promised. Therefore, the higher 4 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nthe credit risk, the higher the interest rates charged by the lender as compensation for bearing \\nthis risk. \\nInterest rates  play  a key role in the valuation of all kinds of ﬁnancial instruments, speciﬁcally, \\ninterest rates are involved to a large extent in the pricing of all derivatives. For any given \\ncurrency, there are many types of rates that are quoted and traded. Therefore, it is important to \\nunderstand the differences between these rates and the implications of each on the valuation \\nof ﬁnancial instruments. \\n1.2.1 LIBOR vs T reasury Rates \\nAmong the more  popular rates, we ﬁnd Treasury rates and LIBOR rates. Treasury rates are the \\nrates earned from bills or bonds issued by governments. Depending on the issuing sovereign \\nbody, these can be considered as risk-free rates since it is assumed that certain governments \\nwill not default on their obligations. However, derivatives traders may use LIBOR rates as \\nshort-term risk-free rates instead of Treasury rates. \\nThe London  Interbank  Offered Rate (LIBOR) is the interest rate at which a bank offers to \\nlend funds to other banks in the interbank market. LIBOR rates can have different maturities \\ncorresponding to the length of deposits and are associated with all major currencies. For \\ninstance, 3-month EURIBOR is the rate at which 3-month deposits in euros are offered; 12-\\nmonth US LIBOR  is the rate at which 12-month deposits in US dollars are offered; and so on. \\nLIBOR will be slightly higher than the London Interbank Bid Rate (LIBID), which is the rate \\nat which banks will accept deposits from other ﬁnancial institutions. \\nTypically, a bank  must have an AA credit rating (the best credit rating given by the rat-\\ning agenc y Standard  and Poor’s being AAA) to be able to accept deposits at the LIBOR \\nrate. A rating as such would imply that there is a small probability that the bank defaults. \\nThis is why LIBOR rates are considered to be risk free although they are not totally free \\nof credit risk. Moreover, a number of regulatory issues can impact the value of Treasury \\nrates and cause them to be consistently low. For this reason, LIBOR is considered by deriva-\\ntives traders  to  be a better measurement of short-term risk-free rates than Treasury rates. In \\nthe world of derivatives, people think directly of LIBOR rates when talking about risk-free \\nrates. \\nThe difference between  the interest rate of 3-month Treasury bills and the 3-month LIBOR \\nis known as the TED spread, and can be used as a measure of liquidity in interbank lending. \\nLIBOR, which corresponds to interbank lending, compared to the risk-free rates of Treasury \\nbills is an indication of how willing banks are to lend money to each other. LIBOR rates involve \\ncredit risk, whereas Treasury rates do not, and thus the TED spread serves as a measure of \\ncredit risk in the interbank market. Higher TED spreads correspond to higher perceived risks \\nin lending, and vice versa. \\n1.2.2 Yield Cur ves \\nF\\nor any major  currency, the interest rates paid on bonds, swaps or futures are closely watched \\nby traders and plotted on a graph against their maturities. These graphs are commonly called \\nyield curves and they emphasize the relationship between interest rates and maturity for a \\nspeciﬁc debt in a given currency. The points on the curve are only known with certainty for \\nspeciﬁc maturity dates; the rest of the curve is built by interpolating these points. 5 Basic Instruments \\nFor each currency, there are several types of yield curves describing the cost of money \\ndepending on the creditworthiness of debtors. The yield curves showing interest rates earned \\nby the holders of bonds issued by governments are called government bond yield curves. \\nBesides these curves, there are corporate curves that correspond to the yields of bonds issued \\nby companies. Because of a higher credit risk, the yields plotted in corporate curves are usually \\nhigher and are often quoted in terms of a credit spread over the relevant LIBOR curve. For \\ninstance, the 10-year yield curve point for Renault might be quoted as LIBOR + 75 bp (a basis \\npoint or bp being equal to 0.01%), where 75 bp is the credit spread. In order to price a ﬁnancial \\ninstrument, a trader will choose the yield curve that corresponds to the type of debt associated \\nwith this instrument. Despite there being different time-periods corresponding to the various \\nrates, they are typically expressed as an annual rate. This allows interest rates to be compared \\neasily. \\nYield curves are  typically upwards sloping, with longer term rates higher than shorter term \\nrates. However, under different market scenarios the yield curve can take several different \\nshapes, being humped or possibly downward sloping. We go into much further detail regarding \\nthe shapes of yield curves when we discuss interest rates in the context of hybrid derivatives \\nin Chapter 17. Credit spreads are also discussed in more detail in Chapter 18 in the context of \\ndefaultable bonds and credit derivatives. \\n1.2.3 Time Value of  Money  \\nThe concept  of  the time value of money is key to all of ﬁnance, and is directly related to \\ninterest rates. Simply put, an investor would rather take possession of an amount of money \\ntoday, for example $1,000, than take hold of the $1,000 in a year, 10 years, or even one week. \\nIn fact, the concept of interest over an inﬁnitesimally small period arises, and the preference is \\nthat an investor would rather have the money now than at any point in the future. The reason \\nis that interest can be earned on this money, and receiving the exact same amount of money at \\na time in the future is a forfeited gain. \\nOne hundred  dollars  to be paid one year from now (a future value), at an expected rate of \\nreturn of i = 5% per year, for example, is worth in today’s money, i.e. the present value: \\n1 100 PV = FV  × = = 95.24 (1 + i  )n 1.05 \\nSo the present  value of 100 dollars one year from now at 5% is $95.24. In the above equation \\nn = 1 is the number of periods over which we are compounding the interest. An important \\nnote is that the rate i is the interest rate for the relevant period. In this example we have an \\nannual rate applied over a 1-year period. Compounding can be thought of as applying the \\ninterest rate to one period and reinvesting the result for another period, and so on. \\nTo correctly  use  interest rates we must convert a rate to apply to the period over which we \\nwant to compute the present value of money. Interest rates can be converted to an equivalent \\ncontinuous compounded interest rate because it is computationally easier to use. We can think \\nof this as compounding interest over an inﬁnitesimally small period. The present value, PV , at \\ntime 0 of a payment at time t in the future, is given in terms of the future value, FV , and the \\ncontinuously compounded interest rate r by \\nPV = FVe−rt /summationdisplay \\n/summationdisplay 6 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nExercise Consider you mak\\n e a deposit of $100 today. Let’s assume that interest rates are constant \\nand equal to 10%. In the case of annual compounding, how many years are needed for the \\nvalue of the deposit to double to $200? \\nDiscussion Let y\\n denote the number of years needed to double the initial investment. Then: FV = \\nPV × (1 + i )y . The present value formula can be rearranged such that \\nln (FV/ PV) ln (200/100 ) 0.693 y = = = = 7.27 ln(1 + i  ) ln(1.10) 0.0953 \\n1years . \\nThis same  method  can be used to determine the length of time needed to increase a \\ndeposit to any particular sum, as long as the interest rate is known. \\n1.2.4 Bonds \\nA bond  is  a debt security used by governments and companies to raise capital. In exchange for \\nlending funds, the holder of the bond (the buyer) is entitled to receive coupons paid periodically \\nas well as the return of the initial investment (the principal) at the maturity date of the bond. \\nThe coupons represent the interest rate that the issuer pays to the bondholders in exchange for \\nholding their debt. Usually, this rate is constant throughout the life of the bond; this is the case \\nof ﬁxed rate bonds. The coupons can also be linked to an index; we then talk about ﬂoating rate \\nnotes. Common indices include money market indices, such as LIBOR or EURIBOR, or CPI \\n(the Consumer Price Index) inﬂation rate linked bonds. Bonds can have a range of maturities \\nclassiﬁed as: short (less than 1 year), medium (1 to 10 years) and long term (greater than 10 \\nyears). In this section we now focus on ﬁxed rate bonds. \\nThe mark et price  of a bond is then equal to the sum of the present values of the expected \\ncashﬂows. Let t denote the valuation date and Ci the value of the coupons that are still to \\nbe paid at coupon dates ti , where t ≤ ti ≤ tn = T . The value of a bond is then given by the \\nfollowing formula: \\nn \\nBond( t, T ) = Ci B(t, ti ) \\ni =1 \\nwhich results in \\nn \\nCi e−r (t,ti )×(ti −t)Bond( t, T ) = \\ni =1 \\nThe price of a bond can be quoted in terms of a normal price as shown above or in terms of \\nyield to maturity y, which represents the current market rate for bonds with similar features. \\n1This is often referred to as T h eR u l eo f7 2 . /summationdisplay 7 Basic Instruments \\nYield to maturity is deﬁned as follows: \\nn \\nCi e−y×(ti −t)Bond( t, T ) = \\ni=1 \\nThe market price of a bond may include the interest that has accrued since the last coupon \\ndate. The price, including accrued interest, is known as the dirty price and corresponds to the \\nfair value of a bond, as shown in the above formula. It is important to note that the dirty price \\nis the price effectively paid for the bond. However, many bond markets add accrued interest \\non explicitly after trading. Quoted bonds, such as those whose prices appear in the Financial \\nTimes are the clean prices of these bonds. \\nClean Price  =  Dirty Price − Accrued Interest \\nBonds are commonly  issued in the primary market through underwriting. Once issued, they \\ncan then be traded in the secondary market. Bonds are generally considered to be a safer \\ninvestment than stocks due to many reasons, one being that bonds are senior to stocks in the \\ncapital structure of corporations, and in the event of default bondholders receive money ﬁrst. \\nBonds can pay a higher interest compared to stocks’ dividends. Also, bonds generally suffer \\nfrom less liquidity issues than stocks. In times of high volatility in the stock market, the bond \\ncan serve as a diversiﬁcation instrument to lower volatility. \\nNonetheless, bonds  are  not free of risk, because bond prices are a direct function of interest \\nrates. In fact, ﬁxed rate bonds are attractive as long as the coupons paid are high compared to \\nthe market rates, which vary during the life of the product. Consequently, bonds are subject \\nto interest rate risk, since a rise in the market’s interest rates decreases the value of bonds and \\nvice versa. We can also understand this effect by looking at the bond price formula: if the \\ninterest rate used to discount the coupons goes up, their present value goes down and the price \\nof the bond decreases. Alternatively, if interest rates go down, bond prices increase. \\nMoreover, bond  prices  depend on the credit rating of the issuer. If credit rating agencies \\ndecide to downgrade the credit rating of an issuer, this causes the relevant bonds to be \\nconsidered a riskier investment, therefore a bondholder would require a higher interest for \\nbearing greater credit risk. Since the coupons are constant, the price of the bond decreases. \\nTherefore, credit risk increases the volatility of bond prices. When turning to some government \\nbonds (for example, US Treasuries), one considers these to be risk free, but any deviation from \\nthese in terms of creditworthiness will be reﬂected in the price as an added risk. \\nIn the case  of callable bonds, the bond can be called , i.e. bought back, by the is-\\nsuer at a  pre-speciﬁed price during some ﬁxed periods laid out in the contract. The \\nbondholder is subject to reinvestment risk. Buying a callable bond is equivalent to buying \\na bond and selling an American call option on this bond. When interest rates go down, the \\nbond’s price goes up and the issuer is more likely to exercise his call option and buy back his \\nbond. The bondholder would then have to reinvest the money received earlier; but in such a \\nscenario, with lower interest rates, it would be hard to enter into a better deal. \\n1.2.5 Zero Coupon  Bonds  \\nZero coupon  bonds  are debt instruments where the lender receives back a principal amount \\n(also called face value, notional or par value) plus interest, only at maturity. No coupons are \\npaid during the life of the product, thus the name. In fact the interest is deducted up front and 8 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nis reﬂected in the price of the zero coupon bond since it is sold at a discount, which means that \\nits price is lower than 100% of the notional. Issuing zero coupon bonds is advantageous from \\na medium-term liquidity perspective, compared to issuing coupon-bearing bonds in which \\npayments will have to be made at various points in the life of the bond. A US Treasury Bill is \\nan example of a zero coupon bond. \\nThe price  of  a zero coupon is equal to the present value of the par value, which is the only \\ncashﬂow of this instrument and paid at maturity T . Zero coupon bonds are tradeable securities \\nthat can be exchanged in the secondary market. Let B(t, T ) denote the price in percentage \\nof notional of a zero coupon bond at time t. Depending on the discounting method used by \\na trader to compute the interest amount, B(t, T ) is directly related to interest rates by the \\nfollowing formulas: \\nLinear: Interest is proportional  to  the length of the loan \\n1 B(t, T ) = 1 + r  (t, T ) × (T − t) \\nActuarial: Interest is compounded periodically  \\n1\\n B(t, T ) = (1 + r  (t, T ))T −t \\nContinuous: Interest is compounded continuously \\nB(t, T ) = e−r (t,T )×(T −t) \\nHere r (t, T ) stands for the appropriate interest rate at time t and maturity (T − t ), which is \\nthe time to maturity of the loan expressed in years. \\nAlso note that  in order to compute, at time t, the present value of any cashﬂow that occurs \\nat time T , one must multiply it by B(t, T ). From now on, we are going to use continuous \\ncompounding to discount cashﬂows for the valuation of derivatives. \\n1.3 EQUITIES AND CURRENCIES \\n1.3.1 Stocks \\nCompanies need  cash  to operate or ﬁnance new projects. It is often the case that their cash \\nincome does not always cover their cash expenditures, and they can choose to raise capital by \\nissuing equity. A share (also referred to as an equity share) of stock entitles the holder to a part \\nof ownership in a corporation. To compensate stockholders for not receiving interest that they \\nmight have received with other investments, companies usually pay them dividends. Dividends \\ncan vary over time depending on the company’s performance and can also be viewed as a part \\nof the company’s proﬁt redistributed to its owners. Therefore, the price of a stock normally \\ndrops by approximately the value of the dividend at the ex-div date, which is the last date \\nafter which the buyer of a stock is not entitled to receive the next dividend payment. Note \\nthat dividends can be expressed as discrete dividends or as a continuous equivalent dividend \\nyield q. \\nWhen buying stocks,  investors typically expect the stock price to increase in order to make \\nproﬁt from their investment. On the other hand, consider an investor who believes a stock price \\nis going to decrease over time. She is then interested in having a short position in this stock. \\nIf her portfolio doesn’t contain it, she can enter into a repurchase agreement or repo.T h i si s 9 Basic Instruments \\na transaction in which the investor borrows the stock from a counterparty that holds the stock \\nand agrees to give it back at a speciﬁc date in the future. Repos allow the investor to hold the \\nstock and sell it short immediately in the belief that she can buy it back later in the market at a \\ncheaper price and return it to the lending counterparty. Repos play a large role as speculative \\ninstruments. It is interesting to note that stock lenders are, for the most part, people who are \\njust not planning to trade in it. They could be investors that own the stock in order to take \\ncontrol of the company, and repos offer them the advantage to earn an added income paid by \\nthe borrowers. The rate of interest used is called the repo rate or borrowing cost. \\nThe stock  price’ s behaviour is not the only important parameter that should be taken \\ninto account when trading stocks. An investor should be cautious with liquidity that can be \\nquantiﬁed by looking at the average daily traded volume. A stock is said to have liquidity \\nif there are many active participants buying and selling it, and that one can trade the stock \\nat a relatively small bid–ask spread. For a stock to be considered liquid, one should be able \\nto buy or sell it without moving its price in the market. Take the scenario where an investor \\nwants to sell a large position in stocks. If the stock is not liquid enough, it is likely that the \\ninvestor wouldn’t ﬁnd a buyer at the right time and would not be able to make a proﬁt from \\nhis investment. At least, it is possible that the seller might not ﬁnd a buyer who is willing to \\nbuy the stock at its fair price, and would have to sell at a price below the actual price just \\nto conduct the transaction. Note that liquidity is correlated to the stock price. If the latter is \\ntoo high or too low, the liquidity of the stock suffers. Expensive stocks are not affordable to \\nall investors, causing the traded volume to be low. Alternatively, very cheap stocks may be \\nde-listed. \\nAnother parameter  that  has to be taken into account is corporate actions. These constitute an \\nevent initiated by a public company, and that may have a direct or indirect ﬁnancial impact on \\nthe security. Companies can choose to use corporate actions to return proﬁts to shareholders \\n(through dividends for example), to inﬂuence the share price or for corporate restructuring \\npurposes. Stock splits and reverse stock splits are respectively used to increase and decrease \\nthe number of outstanding shares. The share price is then adjusted so that market capitalization \\n(the share price times the number of shares outstanding) remains the same. These events can \\nbe an interesting solution to increase the liquidity of a stock. Finally, mergers are an example \\nof corporate actions where two companies come together to increase their proﬁtability. From a \\ntrading perspective, one should be cautious with corporate actions since they can have a great \\nimpact on the price or the liquidity of a stock. \\nLet us no w analyse the forward price of a stock, which is deﬁned as the fair value of the \\nstock at a speciﬁc point of time in the future. The forward price of a stock can be viewed as \\nequal to the spot price plus the cost of carrying it. Consider a share that pays no dividends \\nand is worth $50. Assume that the 6-month interest rates are equal to 6%. Here, the cost of \\ncarry is equal to the interest that might be received by the stockholder if he had immediately \\nsold his shares and invested his money in a risk-free investment. This represents a cost for the \\nstockholder that will be reﬂected in a higher forward price. Therefore, the 6-month forward \\nprice of the stock would be equal to 50e6%× 6/12 = $51.52. \\nIf a stock  provides an additional income to the stockholder, this causes the cost of carry to \\ndecrease, since the stock also becomes a source of proﬁt. Dividends and stock loans constitute \\na source of income when carrying a stock. Therefore, those parameters decrease the forward \\nprice whereas interest rates increase it. Let r, q and b respectively denote the risk-free rate, the \\ndividend yield and the repo rate for a period T . Then the forward price F0(T ) for a speciﬁc \\nstock S is given as follows: F0(T ) = S0 × e(r −q−b)×T . From this relationship we can see that 10 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nan increase of 1% in the stock price will result in a 1% increase in the forward price, all else \\nbeing equal. \\n1.3.2 Foreign Exchange  \\nA\\n currenc y is  a ﬁnancial instrument that can be traded in terms of spot or forward contracts in \\nforeign exchange markets. Most of the major currencies are very liquid and can involve large \\ntransactions. However, one should be cautious with exchange rate quotes and be clear on the \\nforeign exchange (FX) market’s conventions. FX futures are always quoted in number of US \\ndollars (USD) per one unit of foreign currency. Spots and forward prices are quoted in the \\nsame way; for the British pound GBP, the euro EUR, the Australian dollar AUD and the New \\nZealand dollar NZD, the spot and forward quotes show the number of USD per one unit of \\nforeign currency. These quotes can be directly compared to futures quotes. For all other major \\ncurrencies, forward and spot prices are quoted in number of units of foreign currency per one \\nUSD. For instance, if the spot exchange rate between GBP and USD is equal to 2, this means \\n1 GBP = 2 USD. \\nA foreign  currenc y entitles the holder to invest it at the foreign risk-free interest rate rf . \\nIf an investor converts the FX into domestic currency, he can make a deposit at the domestic \\nrisk-free rate rd . A currency can then be viewed as a stock with a dividend yield equal to rf . \\nLet S0 denote the current spot price expressed in dollars of one unit of a foreign currency and \\nF0(T ) denote the fair value of the forward price at time T expressed in dollars of one unit of \\na foreign currency: \\nF0(T ) = S0 × e(rd −rf )×T \\nThe market forward price can be different from the fair value of the forward price expressed \\nabove. This event leads to an arbitrage opportunity, which is an opportunity to make a proﬁt \\nwithout bearing risks. \\nFinally, if a  trader wants to exchange a currency A for a currency B but cannot ﬁnd a quoted \\nprice for the exchange rate, he can use the available exchange rates of these currencies with \\nrespect to a reference currency C. He would then compute the cross rate A/B as follows: \\nA/B =  A/C × C/B \\nForeign exchange is  discussed in more detail in the pre-hybrid derivative asset class analysis \\nof Chapter 18. \\n1.3.3 Indices \\nA stock  mark et index is composed of a basket of stocks and provides a way to measure a \\nspeciﬁc sector’s performance. Stock market indices can give an overall idea about the state \\nof an economy, as is the case for broad-base indices that include a broad set of equities that \\nrepresent the performance of a whole stock market. These indices are the most regularly quoted \\nand are composed of large-cap stocks of a speciﬁc stock exchange, such as the American S&P \\n500, the Japanese Nikkei, the German DAX, the British FTSE 100, the Hong Kong Hang Seng \\nIndex and the EuroStoxx 50. A stock market index can also be thematic or can cover a speciﬁc \\nsector such as the technology or banking sectors. \\nAn index v alue can be computed in two ways. For price-weighted indices, such as the Dow \\nJones Industrial Average in the US, each component’s weight depends only on the price of the 11 Basic Instruments \\nstocks and does not take into account the size of the companies. Therefore, a price-weighted \\nindex value is sensitive to price movements even if it only affects one of its constituent stocks. \\nAnother way to compute an index is based on the market capitalization of stocks. This is the \\ncase of market-value-weighted indices, also called capitalization-weighted indices, where the \\nlargest companies have the greatest inﬂuence on their price. The Eurostoxx 50 index and the \\nHang Seng are good examples of capitalization-weighted indices. \\n1.3.4 Exchange-traded Funds  \\nMuch\\n like stocks,  an exchange-traded fund (or ETF) is an investment vehicle that is traded on \\nstock exchanges. An ETF holds assets such as stocks or bonds and is supposed to trade at (at \\nleast approximately) the same price as the net asset value of its assets – throughout the course \\nof the trading day. Since diversiﬁcation reduces risk, many investors are interested in indices \\nor baskets of assets; however, it is impractical to buy indices because of the large numbers of \\nconstituent stocks and the need to rebalance with the index. Therefore, ETFs can be a great \\nsolution since one can often ﬁnd ETFs that track a speciﬁc index, such as the Dow Jones \\nIndustrial Average or the S&P 500. In one transaction the investor gains exposure to the whole \\nindex without having to buy all the stocks composing the index and adjust their weights as the \\nindex’s weights are changed. \\nETFs generally  pro vide transparency as well as the easy diversiﬁcation across an entire \\nindex. They can have low costs and expense ratios when they are not actively managed and \\ntypically have lower marketing, distribution and accounting expenses. Another advantage of \\nETFs is the tax efﬁciency of index funds, while still maintaining all the features of ordinary \\nstocks, such as limit orders, short selling and options. For an investor, one disadvantage can be \\nthat in some cases, and depending on the nature of the ETF and the complexities involved in \\nits management, relatively signiﬁcant fees may be charged. Because ETFs can be traded like \\nstocks, some investors buy ETF shares as a long-term investment for asset allocation purposes, \\nwhile other investors trade ETF shares frequently to implement investment strategies. ETFs \\nand options on ETFs can also serve as hedging vehicles for some derivatives. \\n1.3.5 Forward Contracts  \\nA\\n forw ard contract  is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a speciﬁed \\npoint of time in the future. This is a pure over-the-counter (OTC) contract since its details are \\nsettled privately between the two counterparties. When issuing a forward contract, the price \\nagreed to buy the asset at maturity is called the strike price. Trading in forwards can be for \\nspeculative purposes: (1) the buyer believes the price of the asset will increase from the trade \\ndate until the maturity date; (2) the seller thinks the value of the asset will appreciate and enters \\ninto a forward agreement to avoid this scenario. Additionally, forward contracts can serve as \\nhedging instruments. \\nGenerally, the strik e price is equal to the fair value of the forward price at the issue date. \\nThis implies that forward contracts are usually arranged to have zero mark-to-market value \\nat inception, although they may be off-market. Examples include forward foreign exchange \\ncontracts in which one party is obligated to buy foreign exchange from another party at a ﬁxed \\nrate for delivery on a preset date. In order to price a forward contract on a single asset, one \\nshould discount the difference between the forward price and the strike price. Assuming that \\nFt (T ) is the theoretical forward price of the asset, the value at time t of the forward contract 12 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nForward t (T ) is computed as follows: \\nForward t (T ) = (Ft (T ) − K ) × e−r ×(T −t) \\nThe main advantage of forwards is that they offer a high degree of ﬂexibility to both parties \\ninvolved, allowing them to set any contract speciﬁcations as long as they are mutually accepted. \\nThis is due to the fact that forward contracts trade in OTC markets and are not standardized \\ncontracts. Besides, it is important to note that a forward contract is an obligation and not an \\noption to buy/sell the asset at maturity. However, the risk remains that one party does not meet \\nits obligations and can default. This risk, called the counterparty risk, is the main disadvantage \\nencountered in trading forwards. \\nExercise Suppose that John\\n  believes the stock price of V odafone will appreciate consistently over \\nthe course of a year. Assume that V odafone is worth £80 and the 1-year LIBOR rate r is \\nequal to 6%. Also, the dividend yield q is equal to 2% and the borrowing costs are null. \\nJohn decides to enter into a 1-year forward contract allowing him to buy 1,000 shares of \\nV odafone in one year at a strike price of £82. After one year, V odafone’s spot price is equal \\nto £86. Did John realize a proﬁt from this transaction? \\nDiscussion First of all\\n  it is interesting to compute the theoretical value of the 1-year forward price F0 of \\n= 80 ×  e(6%− 2%)×1V odafone that is given by F0 = £83.30. As the theoretical forward price \\nis higher than the strike price K , John has to pay a premium Forward price for the forward \\ncontract that is equal to the number of shares times the present value of the difference \\nbetween the forward price and the strike price, as follows: \\nForward price = 1, 000 × (F0 − K ) × e−rT \\n= 1, 000 × (83.30 − 82) × e−5%× 1 = £1, 224 \\nAt the end  of the year, the forward contract entitles John to receive 1,000 shares of \\nV odafone at £82 with a market value equal to £86. Therefore, John makes a proﬁt equal to \\n1, 000 × (86 − 82) = £4, 000 knowing that he paid £1,224 as a forward contract premium. \\n1.3.6 Futures \\nA futures  contract  is an exchange-traded contract in which the holder has the obligation to \\nbuy an asset on a future date, referred to as the ﬁnal settlement date, at a market-determined \\nprice called the futures price. The price of the asset on the ﬁnal settlement date is called the \\nsettlement price. The contract speciﬁcations, including the quantity and quality of the asset as \\nwell as the time and place of delivery, are determined by the relevant exchange. The asset is \\nmost often a commodity, a stock or an index. Stock market index futures are popular because \\nthey can be used for hedging against an existing equity position, or speculating on future \\nmovements of the asset. \\nFutures constitute  a  safer investment since the counterparty risk is (almost) totally elimi-\\nnated. Indeed,  the  clearing house acts as a central counterparty between the buyer and the seller 13 Basic Instruments \\nand also provides a mechanism of settlement based on margin calls . Futures are marked-to-\\nmarket (MTM) on a daily basis to the new futures price. This rebalancing mechanism forces \\nthe holders to update daily to an equivalent forward purchased that day. On the other hand, the \\nbeneﬁts of having such standardized contracts are slightly offset by the lack of ﬂexibility that \\none has when setting the terms of an OTC forward contract. The futures contract is marked-\\nto-market on a daily basis, and if the margin paid to the exchange drops below the margin \\nmaintenance required by the exchange, then a margin call will be issued and a payment made \\nto keep the account at the required level. Margin payments offset some of the exchange’s risk \\nto a customer’s default. \\nThe quoted  price  of a futures contract is the futures price itself. The fair value of a future is \\nequal to the cash price of the asset (the spot value of the asset) plus the costs of carry (the cost \\nof holding the asset until the delivery date minus any income). When computing the fair value \\nof futures on commodity, one should take into account the interest rates as well as storage and \\ninsurance fees to estimate the costs of carry. \\nAs long as  the deliverable asset is not in short supply, one may apply arbitrage arguments \\nto determine the price of a future. When a futures contract trades above its fair value, a cash \\nand carry arbitrage opportunity arises. The arbitrageur would immediately buy the asset at \\nthe spot price to hold it until the settlement date, and at the same time sell the future at the \\nmarket’s futures price. At the delivery date, he would have made a proﬁt equal to the difference \\nbetween the market’s futures price and the theoretical fair value. Alternatively, a reverse cash \\nand carry arbitrage opportunity occurs when the future is trading below its fair value. In this \\ncase, the arbitrageur makes a risk-free proﬁt by short-selling the asset at the spot price and \\ntaking at the same time a long position in a futures contract at the market’s futures price. When \\nthe deliverable asset is not in plentiful supply, or has not yet been created (a corn harvest \\nfor example), the price of a future is determined by the instantaneous equilibrium between \\nsupply and demand for the asset in the future among the market participants who are buying \\nand selling such contracts. The convenience yield is the adjustment to the cost of carry in the \\nnon-arbitrage pricing formula for a forward and it accounts for the fact that actually taking \\nphysical delivery of the asset is favourable for some investors. These concepts are discussed \\nat length for the various asset classes in Chapters 17 and 18 where futures and forward curves \\nare analysed. \\n1.4 SW APS \\n1.4.1 Interest Rate Swaps \\nInterest rate sw aps (IRSs) are OTC agreements between two counterparties to exchange or \\nswap cashﬂows in the future. A speciﬁc example of an IRS is a plain vanilla swap, in which \\ntwo parties swap a ﬁxed rate of interest and a ﬂoating rate. Most of the time, LIBOR is the \\nﬂoating interest rate used in a swap agreement. In an IRS, the notional is the principal amount \\nthat is used to compute interest percentages, but this sum will not actually change hands. \\nPayments are netted, because all cashﬂows are in the same currency; for instance payment \\nof 5% ﬁxed and receipt of 4% ﬂoating will result in a net 1% payment. Payments are based \\non the ﬂoating interest rate observed at the start of the period, but not paid until the end of \\nthe period. More exotic swaps exist where cashﬂows are in different currencies, examples of \\nwhich can be found below. 14 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nThe payer on the swap is the person who agrees to pay the ﬁxed rate (and receive the ﬂoating \\nrate) on a vanilla swap. The payer is concerned that interest rates will rise and would then be \\nreferred to as long the swap. The receiver is the person who agrees to receive the ﬁxed rate (and \\npay the ﬂoating rate) on an IRS. The receiver expects interest rates to fall and would therefore \\nbe referred to as being short the swap. It is because of the different methods of borrowing that \\ninterest rate swaps are useful. A company may either borrow money at ﬁxed or variable rates; \\nit would borrow ﬁxed if it thought rates were going up and variable if it thought they were \\ngoing to fall. An IRS will allow the company to change borrowing styles part way through the \\nterm of the original loan. These are OTC products and, as such, can be tailored to an investor’s \\ncashﬂow needs accordingly. \\nConsider for e xample a 5-year 3-month borrowing facility. The 5 years are split into 3-month \\nperiods; at the beginning of each period the 3-month LIBOR rate is set and applied to the loan. \\nAt the end of each period (the reset date), the interest is paid, and a new LIBOR rate is set \\nfor the next 3-month period. A company with such a facility may approach another institution \\nand arrange an IRS. The institution would agree to pay LIBOR to the company at the end of \\neach 3-month period in exchange for interest payments from the company at a ﬁxed rate. \\nA basis  sw ap is a particular type of IRS where a ﬂoating rate is swapped for a different \\nﬂoating rate. These transactions are used to change the ﬂoating rate basis from one index \\nto another, e.g. exchanging 3-month LIBOR for 6-month LIBOR, or 3-month T-bill rate for \\n6-month Fed Funds. The ﬂoating indices used in these swaps range from LIBOR rates of \\ndifferent tenors or possibly different currencies, to other ﬂoating rates. \\nTo compute  the  value of a swap, one should calculate the net present value (NPV) of all \\nfuture cashﬂows, which is equal to the present value from the receiving leg minus the present \\nvalue from the paying leg. Initially, the terms of a swap contract are deﬁned in such a way \\nthat its value is null, meaning that one can enter into the swap at zero cost. In the case of an \\nIRS, the ﬁxed rate is agreed such that the present value of the expected future ﬂoating rate \\npayments is equal to the present value of future ﬁxed rate payments. \\nExercise Let E denote\\n  the 3-month EURIBOR rate. Consider an interest rate swap contract where \\nParty A pays E to Party B, and Party B pays 24% − 3 × E to Party A. Let N denote the \\nnotional of this swap. Can you express this deal in simpler terms? \\nDiscussion Party A pays\\n  E and receives 24% − 3 × E. This means that Party A receives 24% − 4 × \\nE = 4 × (8% − E). This contract is then equivalent to an interest rate swap arrangement \\nwhere Party A (the receiver) receives 8% from Party B (the payer), and pays E to Party B. \\nThe notional of the equivalent contract is equal to 4 × N . \\n1.4.2 Cross-currency Swaps  \\nA\\n currenc y sw ap is another popular type of swap in which cashﬂows are based on different \\ncurrencies. Unlike an IRS, in a currency swap the notional principal should be speciﬁed \\nin both currencies involved in the agreement. Here, a notional actually changes hands at 15 Basic Instruments \\nBank B Bank A \\n$2million @ 6% $2million @ 4% \\n£1million @ 7% £1million @ 10% Party A Party B \\nFigure 1.1 Borrowing rates. \\nthe beginning and at the termination of the swap. Interest payments are also made without \\nnetting. It is important to note that principal payments are usually initially exchanged using the \\nexchange rate at the start of the swap. Therefore, notional values exchanged at maturity can be \\nquite different. Let’s consider an example of a ﬁxed-for-ﬁxed currency swap, where interest \\npayments in both currencies are ﬁxed, to clarify the payoff mechanism and the cross-currency \\nswap’s use in transforming loans and assets. \\nFigure 1.1 sho ws the case of an American company (Party A) that wants to raise £1m from \\na British bank (Bank B) and a British company (Party B) that needs to borrow $2m from an \\nAmerican bank (Bank A). In this example, we assume that 1 GBP = 2 USD. Let’s keep in \\nmind that interest rate values depend on the creditworthiness of the borrower. In this example, \\nboth companies have similar credit ratings but banks tend to feel more conﬁdent when lending \\nto a local company. Bank B is then ready to lend £1m to Party A at a ﬁxed rate of 10% per \\nannum over a 3-year period, whereas the interest rate is ﬁxed at 7% for Party B. For the same \\nreasons, Bank A accepts to lend its funds at a ﬁxed rate of 4% for Party A, whereas the interest \\nrate would be equal to 6% for Party B. \\nBoth companies  decide  to enter into a currency swap agreement, described in Figure 1.2, \\nto beneﬁt from the difference of loan rates. Party A borrows $2m from Bank A at 4% annual \\nﬁxed rate and Party B borrows £1m from Bank B at a 7% annual rate. At the start date of \\nthe swap, both principals are exchanged, which means that Party A gives $2m to Party B and \\n$2million @ 4% £1million @ 7% \\nParty A Party B \\n$2million @ 4% £1million @ 7% \\nBank B Bank A \\nFigure 1.2 Currency swap (ﬁxed for ﬁxed). 16 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nreceives £1m. At the end of each year, Party A receives $80,000 from Party B (used to pay the \\n4% interest to Bank A) and pays £70,000 to Party B (used to pay the 7% interest to Bank B). \\nAt the outset of the swap, the notional amounts are exchanged again to reimburse the banks. \\nThe overall effect of this transaction is that both companies raised funds at lower interest rates. \\nParty A has borrowed £1m at a rate of 7% instead of 10%. Party B has also made a proﬁt \\nfrom this currency swap since it has paid 4% interest rate instead of 6%. Note that this is a \\nﬁxed-for-ﬁxed currency swap. It is also possible to swap ﬁxed-for-ﬂoating. \\n1.4.3 Total Retur n Swaps  \\nA total return  swap is a swap agreement in which a party pays ﬁxed or ﬂoating interest and \\nreceives the total return of an asset. The total return is deﬁned as the capital gain or loss from \\nthe asset in addition to any interest or dividends received during the life of the swap. Note that \\nthe party that pays ﬁxed or ﬂoating rates believes the asset’s value will appreciate. This party \\nreceives the positive performance of the asset and pays its negative performance. A total return \\nswap enables both parties to gain exposure to a speciﬁc asset without having to pay additional \\ncosts for holding it. \\nAn equity  sw ap is a particular type of total return swap where the asset can be an individual \\nstock, a stock index or a basket of stocks. The swap would work as follows: if an investor \\nbelieves a speciﬁc share will increase over a certain period of time, she can enter into an equity \\nswap agreement. Obviously, this is a purely speculative ﬁnancial instrument since the investor \\ndoes not have voting or any other stockholder rights. Compared to holding the stock, she does \\nnot have to pay anything up front. Instead, she would deposit an amount of money, equal to the \\nspot price of the stock (a different amount in the case of a margin), and would receive interest \\non it. \\nThus, the in vestor creates a synthetic equity fund by making a deposit and being long the \\nequity swap. Typically, equity swaps are entered into to gain exposure to an equity without \\npaying additional transaction costs, locally based dividend taxes. It also enables investors \\nto avoid limitations on leverage and to get around the restrictions concerning the types of \\ninvestment an institution can hold. \\n1.4.4 Asset Swaps  \\nAn\\n asset  sw ap is an OTC agreement in which the payments of one of the legs are funded by a \\nspeciﬁed asset. This asset can be a bond, for example, where the coupons are used as payments \\non one leg of the swap, but the bond, and generally the asset underlying this swap, does not \\nexchange hands. This allows for an investor to pay or receive tailored cashﬂows that would \\notherwise not be available in the market. \\n1.4.5 Dividend Swaps  \\nLastly\\n, a di vidend swap is an OTC derivative on an index or a stock and involves two counter-\\nparties who exchange cashﬂows based on the dividends paid by the index or the stock. In the \\nﬁrst of the two legs a ﬁxed payment is made (long the swap), and in the second leg the actual \\ndividends of the index or the stock are paid (short the swap). The ﬁxed leg payments involve \\na ﬁxed amount that depends on the initial price of the index of the stock. The cashﬂows are \\nexchanged at speciﬁed valuation periods and are based upon an agreed notional amount. In the 17 Basic Instruments \\ncase of an index dividend swap, or a dividend swap on a basket of stocks, the dividends of the \\nconstituents are weighted by the same weights of the index/basket constituents. The dividend \\nswap is a simple and price effective tool for investors to speculate on future dividends directly, \\nand it can also serve as a vehicle for traders holding portfolios of stocks to hedge dividend \\nrisk. The liquidity of such swaps has increased in recent years for both these reasons. 2 \\nThe World of Structured Products \\nI am long on ideas, but short on time. I only expect to live only about a hundred years. \\nThomas A. Edison \\nThe business of equity and hybrid structured products grew quickly over the last 20 years. \\nThis chapter describes how structured products came into existence and why they became so \\npopular. Structured products can serve as diversiﬁcation or yield enhancement vehicles, and \\nalso as speciﬁcally tailored hedging or speculative tools. We shall consider each of these roles \\nand analyse the composition of structured products from a technical point of view. Investment \\nbanks typically sell structured products to retail clients and institutionals through issues that \\ncan be of small or large size. In a platform of structured products and exotic options, we can ﬁnd \\ndistinct roles involved in the different stages of the life of a product. On the front ofﬁce side, \\nthe sales people, the structurers and traders are all of central importance in the development \\nof this business. We discuss their various tasks in the context of structured products. We then \\nexplain how ﬁnancial institutions issue these sophisticated assets in the over-the-counter (OTC) \\nmarkets and guarantee their valuation on secondary markets. The design and composition of \\na structured note is analysed as an example. \\n2.1 THE PRODUCTS \\n2.1.1 The Birth of Structured Products \\nIn the early  1990s, many investment banks thought up new solutions to attract more investors \\nto equity markets. The idea was to create innovative options with sophisticated payoffs that \\nwould be based on all types of assets such as stocks, indices, commodities, foreign exchange \\nand all kinds of funds. Also, banks were looking for intelligent ways to provide investors with \\neasy access to these innovations through issuing wrappers (medium-term notes, insurance life \\ncontracts, collective funds) in a tax efﬁcient manner. Moreover, it was important to structure a \\nbusiness that was capable of following an issued ﬁnancial asset throughout its life. Therefore, \\nstructuring roles were created to compose complex OTC products; while quantitative analysts \\ndeveloped pricing models to enable traders to hedge the products until maturity. Banks were \\nalso conscious about the importance of providing secondary markets that introduced the \\nliquidity the business needed to expand. \\nEfforts were  made  to provide access and exposure to market conﬁgurations that previously \\npresented entry barriers and were unattainable using standardized ﬁnancial instruments. Struc-\\ntured products  constitute  a great solution to beneﬁt from the dynamism of ﬁnancial markets \\nwith risk/return proﬁles that can be tailored to any investor’s appetite in a cost-effective man-\\nner. One e xample is placing part of an investment in non-risky assets in order to deliver a level \\nof protected capital, while the remaining is invested in options that offer upside opportunities \\nwith no downside. 20 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n2.1.2 Structured Product  Wrappers \\nA structured  product  can be launched in a speciﬁc wrapper, with a determined legal status, to \\nmeet the clients’ requirements in terms of regulatory issues and investment preferences. The \\npayoff of a structured product is important, although it is equally important to know about \\nthe regulations and laws surrounding a certain market in order to determine the appropriate \\nwrapper. \\nDeposits are a  form of wrapper where the bank accepts money from an investor and, at the \\nend of an agreed ﬁxed term, makes a payment back to the depositor. The bank can charge the \\ndepositor a penalty if they choose to end the deposit before its term is up. The interest paid \\non structured deposits is deﬁned as a payoff formula linked to the performance of an asset. \\nCertiﬁcates of Deposits (CDs) are deposits that are structured to be a tradeable certiﬁcate. \\nCDs also have a ﬁxed term and interest is determined on the basis of the performance of an \\nasset. Indeed, in certain regulatory zones, investors can avoid some tax by buying certiﬁcates, \\ninstead of other available products, because the returns paid on such investments are taxed \\ndifferently to others. \\nNotes and bonds are debt instruments issued by a ﬁnancial institution or corporation. They \\nare typically issued as senior unsecured debt (taking priority over other debt in the event of a \\ndefault of the issuer) and can be listed or unlisted. It is important to point out that investing \\nin a note does not mean that the capital invested is guaranteed. In fact, the investor could be \\nselling an option inside a note (an embedded option) that causes the capital to be at risk. An \\nexample of this would be a reverse convertible, where the investor usually sells a put option \\nat maturity of the note. Even if the note is structured with an option in a manner that capital \\nis protected, there is still the risk that the issuer of the note defaults. Although it may have \\nseemed unlikely, examples from the crash of 2008 were learned the hard way. \\nA structured  product  can be launched as a fund. A fund is an investment scheme that is \\nset up to produce a certain return, typically a minimum return with the possibility of returns \\ngreater than this minimum amount depending on the performance of some assets. In the context \\nof structured products, funds can be set up to enter into derivative transactions to provide a \\ndesired exposure, and the investor buys units in this fund. These are generally more expensive \\nthan notes and certiﬁcates, but can prove the optimal choice depending on tax and regulatory \\nissues. \\nStructured products  can  also be launched in the form of over-the-counter options or warrants. \\nThe holder of the warrant is entitled to buy a speciﬁc amount of shares in a company at an \\nagreed price – typically higher than the underlying stock’s price at the time the warrant is \\nissued. 2.1.3 The Structur ed\\n  Note \\nA structured  note  is composed of a non-risky asset providing a percentage of protected capital \\nand a risky asset offering leverage potential. The non-risky part can be a zero coupon bond, \\npaying a guaranteed amount at maturity, or a bond that pays ﬁxed coupons throughout the life \\nof the note; this is the case for income products. The bond is considered non-risky in the sense \\nthat if there is no default by the issuer, then it is guaranteed to return the principal at maturity \\nplus whatever interest is agreed on. A zero coupon bond is always bought at discount; its price \\nis lower than the principal redeemed at maturity. We can then consider that its value increases \\nlinearly (considering very low rate variations) through the life of the product to reach the level 21 The World of Structured Products \\nFinal Value \\n100% of notional premium \\nProtected capital \\npaid at discount Leverage assets Options payoff \\nNon-risky asset Initial Value \\nFigure 2.1 Breakdown of a typical note. \\nof protected capital at maturity. The principal is not necessarily guaranteed if the investor sells \\nthe product before maturity. \\nThe risky part  of a structured note can be composed of options on single or multiple assets. \\nAn option gives the right but not the obligation to buy or sell underlying assets; as such, its value \\nis always positive. Options enable their holders to make additional proﬁt with high leverage \\npotential. These are risky investments since their value can vary greatly. They can provide \\noption holders with high returns, but they can also lose all their value, expiring worthless, in \\nthe case of wrong market expectations. An options price is non-linear and is subject to many \\nmarket parameters. The ﬁnancial risks involved in options trading can be complex and vary \\nsigniﬁcantly from one type of option to another. Pricing models are built and developed by \\nquantitative analysts and then used for pricing and risk analysis by structurers and traders. \\nFigure 2.1 shows the composition and the value of structured notes. These products enable \\ninvestors to receive high leverage potential while simultaneously providing capital protection. \\n2.2 THE SELL SIDE \\nIn this section we focus on the distinct and key aspects of the roles of people involved on the \\nsell side of structured products. We note that at different institutions, roles and responsibilities \\nvary, but most features of the roles discussed here are constant throughout. \\n2.2.1 Sales and Mark eting \\nThe salespeople  are  in charge of creating new markets and servicing existing clients. They \\ntypically sell structured products to existing or new clients but they could also be in charge of \\nbuying products from other counterparties. Salespeople get commission for the transactions 22 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nthey settle; this remuneration depends on the number, the size and the nature of the deals. \\nSalespeople play an important role as they initiate the birth of a structured product through \\nmarketing techniques. \\nBefore issuing  a  structured product, salespeople will spend time with potential buyers \\nduring which they explain the payoff through formulas and examples of possible scenarios \\nin order to describe the exposure the product offers. The client is not necessarily interested \\nin understanding the composition of the structured product from a technical point of view; \\nhowever, the client will probably be keen to understand its payoff mechanism in addition to its \\npotential return. Salespeople use the whole array of marketing methods to explain a product \\nand emphasize its uses. \\nBack-testing is a  popular technique used by a sales department. The idea is to present the \\nreturns that would have been paid to the client if he had invested in this product in the past. \\nThese can express the leverage potential through the past performance of structured products. \\nIt is possible to design products or change the parameters of various existing products to \\nmake the back-tests look better, thus making the product more appealing and easier to market. \\nThe back-test can target speciﬁc times or market scenarios in the past that are relevant to the \\npayoff at hand and exhibit its strengths under such scenarios. The reliability of back-testing \\nincreases with the amount of historical data used, in the sense that more market scenarios have \\nbeen covered. However, the famous line that appears with each back-test stating that ‘past \\nperformance is not indicative of future performance’ is true: we cannot know for sure what \\nwill happen in the market, and though a product may exhibit a stellar back-test, it may fail to \\nhold up such returns in the future. Despite this, the back-test remains a powerful marketing \\ntool. \\nOther mark eting techniques  include stress tests that consist of scenarios showing the be-\\nhaviour of the  marketed product in the hypothetical context of a difﬁcult market. The aim here \\nis to show that the structured product to be issued is strong enough to bear the ﬁnancial risks \\nthat can appear in extreme market conditions. For instance, a stress test can be used to show \\nthat a growth and income product would still behave well in the context of a market crash. \\nStress tests can be presented to emphasize the safety behind investing in structured products, \\nparticularly if they are set up for a scenario for which no precedence exists, i.e. in this case the \\nback-test would be impossible to conduct. \\n2.2.2 Traders and Structur ers \\nThe role of  the structurer varies from one institution to the next, but generally involves creating \\nnew structures as well as pricing these structures. When creating new products, the structurer \\nis involved in innovation, and to do this meaningfully there must be a clear interaction with \\nsales teams because there must ultimately be an investor willing to buy such product for it to \\nbe traded. This role is of key importance in the business of derivatives since an investment \\nbank can stand out with its capability of innovating in a competitive market. The role of the \\nstructurer in pricing structured products involves analysing their risks before the trade can be \\ndone. The structurer will work closely with traders to agree on the levels they charge for taking \\non certain risks, and reﬂect these when making prices and considering new payoff structures. \\nAfter a deal  is sealed with the word “done”, the structured product sold is booked in the \\nportfolio of a trader who will be in charge of hedging its risks. Vanilla products are typically risk \\nmanaged by volatility traders, whereas exotic traders are in charge of more complex products. \\nDepending on the size of the trading desk in a bank, these will break down into further 23 The World of Structured Products \\ncategories where single stock options, multiple stock options, index options are additionally \\nbroken down after separation of exotics from vanillas. Even further sector-wise or region-wise \\nbreakdowns are common. At investment banks, which in the context of structured products are \\nstructurally sell-side institutions, the role of exotic traders is that of a hedger primarily; not a \\nspeculator. Although various levels of speculation are necessary, the central role is to identify \\nand hedge risk. The more complex the product the more elaborate the risks, with many of these \\nrisks impossible to hedge completely. As such it is the role of the exotics trader to manage \\nthese risks as best as possible to be within certain speciﬁed limits. \\nSales are primarily  interested in settling as many deals as possible to increase their commis-\\nsions. Traders, on  the other hand, want business, but unless forced to by management will not \\nwant to take on unhedgeable risks if they feel such positions will cost them money, resulting \\nin a loss in their compensation. There are different balances of power at play, where sales can \\nsometimes force a trade to happen even if the structurer and trader believe it is undervalued \\nand is a losing deal. This can be the case when other players in the market are mispricing \\nderivatives, and a misprice must be met if the bank wants to win an auction-based trade. \\nAlternatively, a relatively powerful trading desk will not be forced to take on a position with \\nwhich it is not comfortable. A large part of this boils down to the bank’s business model that \\nwill govern how structurally conservative or aggressive the desk is. \\n2.3 THE BUY SIDE \\nTo have meaning, an exchange of cashﬂows must involve more than one party. While the sell \\nside is set up to offer structured products, there must be some form of client who will buy \\nthe said products. Without having two parties there can be no such business. It is important \\nto differentiate between the various clients that form the buy side in the structured products \\nbusiness, speciﬁcally, their exposure requirements and risk appetites. Buy side clients can be \\nclassiﬁed into two categories: retail and institutionals. \\n2.3.1 Retail Investors \\nRetail investors are  usually asset management institutions that buy structured products from \\ninvestment banks and redistribute them to individuals. For example, customers of high street \\nbanks can get relatively easy access to some structured products that their bank is distributing. \\nNaturally, the payoff is simpliﬁed and marketed; individuals then have access to attractive \\npayoffs and can spend small or large amounts of money in such investments. Obviously, \\nindividuals do not need to know about the composition of the product or the technical details \\nbehind its structure, but they should be aware of the risks involved. \\nRetail investors are  prepared to market many structured products, especially if they believe \\nthey can ﬁnd enough demand among their client base. Selling a ﬁnancial derivative implies \\nbearing the risks associated with it, and retail investors are usually not willing or not able to \\ntake those risks – it is not their job. Instead, they prefer to pay commissions to an investment \\nbank that has its own trading teams to hedge the marketed structured products. Structured \\nproducts transfer risk over to those who are willing to bear it, typically based on their ability \\nto hedge these risks. For instance, consider a retail investor who buys a note at 98% of the \\nnotional and sells it to individuals at a price of 100% of the notional, realizing a proﬁt of 2% \\non whatever notional amount they are able to sell. The transaction is not really free of risk \\nsince a retail investor is still exposed to credit risk. 24 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nDepending on the retail investor’s relationship with the investment banks it trades with, \\nit may request prices from multiple banks. Before doing a trade, the investor will have \\nseen indicative prices from all the counterparties and will move to a live auction once their \\nrequirements are fulﬁlled. One reason for this could be to obtain the best price possible by \\ntrading with the bank offering the most competitive live price for the same product. The \\ninvestor may also spread a large notional over several of the banks with the best prices. The \\ncategories of yield enhancement products and diversiﬁcation instruments are popular among \\nretail investors. 2.3.2 Institutional Investors \\nInstitutional inv\\n estors represent a different category of structured product clients of invest-\\nment banks.  The y are more ﬁnancially sophisticated than a retail investor, and these include \\ninstitutions such as hedge funds and mutual funds. Such clients often hold large portfolios and \\nthe notional sizes of their transactions can be quite signiﬁcant in both size and complexity. \\nThe complexity comes from both the sophistication of some of their investment strategies, \\nand also from their standing with respect to securities laws or the inapplicability thereof. \\nOther institutional investors include central banks, sovereign wealth funds, state or corporate \\npension funds, social security organizations, insurance companies, proprietary desks at banks, \\nendowments, charities and foundations. All are examples of possible institutional investors \\nemphasizing the great scope of clients interested in structured products. \\nInstitutional inv estors typically have cash to invest and subsequently search for attractive \\nand interesting products that match their target of risk and returns. Investment banks will \\nproduce the business-tailored solution that will best suit the needs of institutionals. In many \\ncases, this is less competitive than the retail business but more difﬁcult in the sense that the \\ndevelopment of the solution is a much larger part of the job. Owing to their sophistication over \\nend retail investors, the scope of products that can be marketed to them is larger and room for \\ninnovation is thus greater. \\nExamples of these  can be tailored derivatives that encapsulate the views a hedge fund wishes \\nto express, and can reach any level of complexity. These can be complex equity exotics and \\npossibly hybrid derivatives. Structuring speciﬁc portfolio hedges for such clients is another \\nexample, and again, the complexities of these investors’ strategies can require complex exotic \\nproducts. Others include the structuring of vanilla options based on complex underlyings \\ninstead of complex options on common underlying assets. The underlyings designed can be \\nthematic indices or dynamic strategies (discussed in Chapter 21) that can be designed to meet \\nthe investors’ required market exposures, and also their risk–return appetites. \\n2.3.3 Bullish vs Bearish,  the  Economic Cycle \\nA bullish in vestor believes a market, sector or speciﬁc asset will appreciate in value whereas \\na bearish client expects its value to go down. We can see different amounts of demand for the \\ntypes of structured products, given the economic outlook and the views these products express. \\nDuring wealth and economical growth periods, investors are usually bullish whereas they tend \\nto be bearish during recession periods. Greed and fear are two distinct emotions that manifest \\nthemselves at different speeds and for different amounts of time during economic cycles. \\nAn individual b uying a speciﬁc asset wants its value to appreciate over time. He is then \\nsaid to be long this asset. Alternatively, somebody selling a ﬁnancial asset wants its value to 25 The World of Structured Products \\ndecrease and is said to be short this asset. Using the terms long and short more generally, one \\nbeing long or short any parameter impacting an asset would like its value to go up or down \\ndepending on it having a positive or negative impact on the asset respectively. For example, \\nthe holder of a ﬂoating bond is long the bond but is also short interest rates since the bond’s \\nvalue increases explicitly when the interest rate on which it is based decreases. \\nStructured products  of fer a great range of bearish ﬁnancial products, bullish products and \\nalso mixtures, thus supplying the demand side with a variety of choices for their various \\noutlooks. Depending on their levels of risk aversion, investors will choose among the different \\ntypes of structured products offered by investment banks. Capital protected structures are \\npopular since they provide investors with a guaranteed minimum return at maturity at least \\nequal to the original investment, while offering leverage potential. Yield enhancement products, \\non the other hand, offer above market returns as long as an event does not occur – typically a \\nlarge equity downside move – in which case capital is at risk. \\nThere are se veral types of products providing different streams of payments, again depending \\non the way a client wants to be paid. Income structured products are ﬁnancial structures that \\noffer periodic coupon payments, i.e. a stream of income. The coupons are, most of the time, \\nhigher than the rate of interest available on ﬁxed rate bank deposits. Here, it is easy to ﬁgure out \\nthat in the case of a capital guaranteed income product, the non-risky part paying ﬁxed coupons \\nis composed of a bond paying periodic ﬁxed coupons and 100% of the notional at maturity. \\nA growth product  produces a return at maturity based on the performance of an underlying \\nasset or the basket of underlying assets, with no coupon payments during the product life. A \\ngrowth product can be either principal guaranteed or non-guaranteed, although the former is \\ncommon. Here the non-risky part of the structured note is composed of a zero coupon bond \\nsince no intermediate payments are made during the life of the product. Growth and Income \\ndescribes a structure that produces ﬁxed returns at speciﬁed periods during the life of the \\nproduct and a return at maturity based on the performance of one or more underlying assets. \\nAfter choosing  the  type of payoff that will meet the investor’s view on the market, the \\nmaturity of the structured product has to be speciﬁed; and this can be done according to the \\nperiod of time during which the investor believes his expectations will be realized. Maturities \\nvary from 3 months (short-term investment periods) to 10 years (long-term investment peri-\\nods). Most  of  the time, maturities are around 2–5 years, which corresponds to medium-term \\ninvestments. \\nShort-term inv estments can be structured that involve high risk and offer enhanced yields. \\nIn these cases investors hope to obtain the above market coupon and get their money back \\nquickly. The appetite for perceived high risks reduces as maturities grow longer. As such, \\nlonger-dated structures tend to have different features to short-dated ones. Some structures \\nwith a ﬁxed maturity can be callable prior to this date, i.e. redeemable by the issuer prior to \\nthe product’s maturity. This is the case of autocallable products (which will be analysed in \\ndetail in Chapter 12) that mature early once a predetermined target coupon level is reached. \\n2.3.4 Credit Risk  and  Collateralized Lines \\nThe buyer of  a ﬁnancial product from an investment bank must pay careful attention to the \\nseller’s credit rating. It gives valuable information regarding the creditworthiness of an issuing \\nﬁnancial institution. An investor can decide to trade in a product with a top credit-rated \\ncompany even if he ﬁnds a more attractive and cheaper one issued by a ﬁnancial institution \\nwith a lower credit rating. Before the subprime crisis, investors were conﬁdent in the ﬁnancial 26 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nsystem and were paying less attention to credit risk. In 2008, banking ﬁrms were battered \\nduring the crisis and many banks collapsed because of the lack of liquidity. Everybody will \\nremember the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. as well as the cases of Bear Stearns \\nCos, Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. that had to be taken over. These events shed light on \\nthe seriousness of credit risk in the trade process. Credit risk resulting from a ﬁnancial ﬁrm’s \\nissuance of bonds, which are often used as the non-risky part of a structured product, can be \\nhedged using credit default swaps (CDSs). These are looked at in more detail when discussing \\ncredit as an asset class in Chapter 18. \\nCollateralized line in vestments are those that do not involve counterparty risk. When we \\nconsider swaps, the way to avoid problems with default events is to structure the swap along \\ncollateralized lines. This involves computing the value of the swap and setting aside the \\nequivalent amount of collateral, typically with a third party. In a swap this would typically \\nbe done on (or at least around) the dates where cashﬂows are computed. This can also be \\napplied to OTC derivatives, and be used to protect the investors buying these derivatives. \\nNaturally this requirement comes at a cost to the investor, but, nonetheless, with the collapses \\nwitnessed in 2008 collateralized products have gained further popularity. The seller of the \\nOTC product would essentially need to set aside cash in order to safeguard any returns earned \\non the derivative prior to maturity. It is expected that a larger portion of structured products in \\nthe future will be structured with some method of mitigating counterparty risk. \\nThe rate used  when pricing the zero coupon bond part of the note is essentially a reference \\nrate, for example LIBOR, plus some spread. This spread, which is the rate that the treasury \\nof the bank offers on deposits, reﬂects the credit rating of the bank, yet the implied offered \\nrate is typically less than the spread implied from credit default swaps on the same bank. The \\nfunding rate for AAA-rated companies can be around 20 bp per annum, whereas it can reach \\nlevels of 600 bp (6%) and above for riskier companies of lower credit ratings. \\nWhen building a  structured note, the bonds of the bank with the lower credit rating cost \\nless, and thus there is more money remaining to put into the risky part of the note. This means \\nthat the riskier bank can potentially offer a higher participation rate on a structure than the less \\nrisky bank can. Investors know the implications of lower credit ratings on their structured note \\ninvestments, and understand why a lower-rated bank may be offering better prices on the same \\nstructure. In times of distress there is what is known as a ﬂight to quality , where investors seek \\nto hold the notes of the highest credit-rated ﬁrms to lower their risk as much as possible. \\n2.4 THE MARKET \\n2.4.1 Issuing a Structured Product  \\nInvestment banks  can  raise capital through issuing structured products at a speciﬁc price \\nexpressed in percentage of the notional size. The size of transactions depends on the type \\nof business involved. Concerning retail investors’ business, a typical notional of transactions \\nwould be around $5–20 million. Transactions can be bigger and deals can have notionals \\naround $100 million or more, especially in the case of large retail distributors. In this case, \\ninvestors may prefer to cut the notional into separate tranches. For instance, an investor who \\nwants to have $100 million exposure to a ﬁnancial asset can buy for $50 million notional \\nfrom the bank that offers the cheapest price, $30 million notional from the bank that offers the \\nsecond cheapest price and $20 million notional from the bank that offers the third cheapest \\nprice. This enables the investor not to be fully dependent on the bid–ask quotes of a unique 27 The World of Structured Products \\nbank if he wants to close or decrease his exposure, and this method can also help to spread \\nsome of the risk of having just one counterparty. \\nThe size of  transactions is important in the valuation of the options composing the structured \\nproduct. In some cases where the notional of a transaction is large and the product carries a \\nlarge amount of unhedgeable risk, one will see a substantial dispersion in the prices offered \\nby different banks. Assuming that all the banks involved are correctly aware of all the risks, \\nthen the differences in prices are a reﬂection of how aggressive or conservative the banks are. \\nFrom the banks’ perspective, the advantage of having one big size transaction, compared to \\nmany smaller ones – besides continuing business with a client and gaining new business – is \\ntwo-fold. First, from the structural point of view of the ﬁrm, and considering the number of \\npeople involved in such a deal from start to ﬁnish, there is cost involved in terms of hours \\nspent. Depending on the setup of the bank, this can be cheaper than several smaller products. \\nSecondly, the proﬁt is a percentage of the transaction’s notional; then a big size issue can \\nimply a large dollar amount of P&L. In competitive auctions, sellers cannot charge high levels \\nof P&L, but do typically have priority should the investor wish to unwind the product; if the \\nseller is offering a two-way market, they can potentially charge if the trade is unwound. For \\nrelatively simple trades in auction sales, margins are typically of the order of 50 bp to 1%. For \\nsolution-driven products, especially where the bank is offering a proprietary solution, margins \\ncan go as high as several percent. \\nThe contractual  agreement  explaining the features of the issue of a speciﬁc structured \\nproduct is referred to as a term sheet. It includes such information as: the issuer, its credit \\nrating, the notional size and price of the product; and the denomination of its currency. Also, \\nterm sheets contain formulas explaining the payoff in detail and specify with complete clarity \\nthe underlying assets involved in the product. The observation and payment dates are also \\nprecisely speciﬁed in the term sheet. As structured products are sold over the counter, the term \\nsheet must be a sound legal contract. \\n2.4.2 Liquidity and a Two-way Market \\nStructured products  became  popular because they can provide good returns in a cost-effective \\nmanner. An important factor that allowed these attractive OTC products to be sold is the two-\\nway market the sell side offers, thus providing the investor with liquidity. Investment banks \\nand other ﬁnancial institutions issuing structured products are aware that the banking system \\nis based on conﬁdence and are willing to gain more clients by offering them enough liquidity, \\nenabling them to close their investment positions or unwind partial notionals if they wish. The \\nintroduction of this feature has helped the business to grow, and there is a secondary market \\nfor structured products. The mess of 2008–2009 in the ﬁnancial world has, however, proved \\nthat, when dealing with secondary market valuations there is a greater need for transparency, \\nto help to address the issue of liquidity. \\nTraders estimate  the  market value of structured products and make bid and ask quotes \\nthat are often available for investors. The bid price is equal to the fair price minus a spread, \\nwhereas the ask price (also called the offer price) is equal to the fair value plus a spread. \\nIn normal market conditions, bid–ask spreads are equal around the mid-price and decrease \\nwith increased liquidity. If investment banks issuing structured products face problems in \\nrisk-managing a speciﬁc product, they will increase the bid–ask spreads. In order to produce \\na consistent valuation for an OTC structured product, the trader must mark to market so that \\nthe valuation reﬂects current market data. 28 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nValuation teams, responsible for reporting valuations, help the salespeople to provide the \\ninvestors with quotes. This is again important since the clients may want to decrease their \\nexposure to the structure by selling a part of their notional at the bank’s bid price, or may \\nwant to increase their exposure by buying more notional at the bank’s offer price. The roles \\nof valuation teams will prove more important as we move forward in the ﬁnancial world. \\nAdditionally, other than marking to market based on liquid data, illiquid parameters that cannot \\nbe implied easily, such as correlation, will need to be monitored more closely. These can greatly \\nimpact valuations and the whole value of the trading books that are exposed to them. Market \\nconsensus data providing ﬁrms can be utilized so that illiquid parameters impacting the value \\nof trading books are at least marked at some market consensus between participating ﬁrms. \\n2.5 EXAMPLE OF AN EQUITY LINKED NOTE  \\nThe equity linked note (ELN) is a simple structured product that makes a single payment to the \\ninvestor at maturity, of a percentage of capital plus participation on the positive performance \\nof a speciﬁc underlying equity asset (stock, index, basket of stocks). It is composed of a \\nzero coupon bond delivering a guaranteed notional amount at maturity, and a European call \\noption on the underlying asset. Figure 2.2 describes how a bank creates a structure (in this \\nObjectives \\nConclusion European call option Bond at a price of 69.5% \\nThe bank charges 50 bp P&L 10-year maturity structure \\nIssue price: 98% of notional The zero coupon enables to pay 100% of notional at maturity \\nwill certainly be worth 100% in 10 years \\nThis amount is computed by deducting the amount from the issue price (98%) \\nIt would be invested in a 10-year European Denominated in USD \\n100% of notional paid at maturity \\n26.7% of notional \\nRemember we have 28% to invest in the structure \\nThe participation rate represents the performance to be paid at maturity to the equity linked note (ELN) holder It is possible to create a product that meets the customer’s needs \\n100% of the notional is guaranteed at maturity \\nAdditional return paid at maturity and performance \\nParticipation is determined using the following computation 28% / 26.7% = 105% Pricing an at-the-money \\nDetermining the participation Creating a 10-year Zero Coupon \\nfrom the transaction; Still 28% of the notional to be invested A zero coupon bond priced at 69.5% today \\nZC price (69.5%) and the P&L (0.5%) \\ncall option on S&P 500 Return linked to S&P 500 performance \\nA 10 year European ATM call is worth \\npercentage of the S&P 500 positive \\nequal to 105% of the positive S&P 500 \\nFigure 2.2 An example of an equity linked note structure. 29 The World of Structured Products \\nFair value \\n(in % of notional) \\n0 70 100 Option value \\nZero Coupon value \\nTime \\nFigure 2.3 Valuation in secondary market. \\ncase an ELN) in order to meet some predetermined targets depending on client require-\\nments. \\nELN value = ZCprice + Call price + P&L @ origination \\nFigure 2.3 emphasizes  the fair value of the product quoted in secondary markets after the \\nissue has been done. The non-risky part has an initial price linked to interest rates. High interest \\nrates decrease the initial value of the zero coupon bond, enabling the structurer to create an \\nattractive payoff through issuing increased upside in the equity. During the life of the structured \\nnote, the value of the non-risky part increases when interest rates decrease. At maturity, the \\nvalue of this zero coupon bond is equal to 100% of the notional. On the other hand, the value \\nof the risky part is non-linear and ﬂuctuates depending on many market parameters such as \\nthe underlying’s spot, interest rates, borrowing costs, dividend yield or volatility. All these \\nsensitivities will be covered in the following chapters. 3 \\nVanilla Options \\nIf your knowledge teaches you not the value of things, and frees you not from the bondage to \\nmatter , you shall never come near the throne of Truth. \\nKahlil Gibran  \\nAn option is a contract between two parties that gives the buyer some form of rights, but \\nnot obligation, to buy or sell a particular asset in the future at a certain price. The term \\nvanilla is used to describe an option that doesn’t have a complicated structure. These are \\ntypically European call or put options that have quite simple payoffs, though other slightly \\nmore complicated structures can also be considered vanillas. It is important to fully understand \\nthe payoff mechanism as well as the risks associated with trading in vanilla options before \\ndiscussing exotic structures. The term exotic is used to describe derivatives that are more \\ncomplex in nature. \\nIn this chapter , we ﬁrst present the general features of European option contracts, and discuss \\ntheir nature as leverage instruments; indeed calls and puts constitute low-cost investments to \\nget upside or downside exposure to an underlying asset. We also see European options in their \\nrole as hedging instruments. The concepts behind the Black–Scholes theory of option pricing \\nare discussed, and we give the Black–Scholes formulas for calls and puts on a stock. These \\nclosed formulas can be extended to FX rates since a currency can be viewed as a stock, as \\nshown in Chapter 1. Note that the underlying asset can also be a commodity or an interest \\nrate (these cases are covered in Chapter 17 in discussions of separate asset classes). This leads \\nto the discussion of American and Asian options, which can also be considered as relatively \\nvanilla. The chapter ends with a section dedicated to presenting examples of the structuring \\nprocess, using what we have learned so far. \\n3.1 GENERAL FEATURES  OF OPTIONS \\nA European call/put option is a contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, \\nto buy/sell an agreed quantity n of a predetermined underlying asset S, at a speciﬁc price K \\nreferred to as the strike, at maturity T . At maturity, the buyer of a European call option would \\nexercise this right as the holder of the option, if the underlying asset’s spot price is higher than \\nthe strike price of the option. Conversely, a put option would be exercised if ST ,t h e v a l u eo f \\nthe underlying asset at time T , is lower than K . An option is said to be European if it pays at \\nmaturity and is only based on ST . In the case of American options, the holder has the right to \\nexercise his option at any time before the expiry date. Bermudan options, which are in a sense \\nin between European and American options, give the holder the right to exercise during some \\nspeciﬁed set of dates between the initial and expiry dates. \\nSome option  contracts  contain a physical delivery feature. This means that the call option \\nseller or the put option buyer will deliver the stocks at maturity when the option is exercised. \\nIndeed, the holder of a call would buy the underlying stock at the strike price K by exercising 32 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nthe option, take hold of the stock, and immediately sell it at the higher market price ST in the \\nmarket. On the other hand, the put option seller would sell the stocks at K and immediately \\nbuy it back from the market at a lower price ST . Other speciﬁcations of the option can be to \\ncash settle the option. In this case, the call option seller makes a cash payment at maturity equal \\nto the positive difference between the ﬁnal spot and strike prices; and the put buyer would \\nreceive the positive difference between K and ST . Cash delivery is often preferred when the \\nunderlying stock has poor liquidity. \\nAn option  is  said to be at-the-money (ATM) if the strike price is the same as the current \\nprice of the underlying asset when the option is written; i.e. the strike is at 100% of the current \\nvalue of the underlying asset. A call option is said to be in-the-money (ITM) when the strike \\nprice is below the current trading price. A put option is in-the-money when the strike price is \\nabove the spot price. Another characteristic of in-the-money options, as we shall see, is when \\nthe current price is much higher than the strike price; for a call option, this option behaves like \\nthe underlying security. Following the deﬁnition of call and put options, at the maturity date, \\nonly in-the-money options are exercised. The third state of a call option is out-of-the-money \\n(OTM), and this is when the strike price is above the current trading price of the underlying \\nsecurity. A put option is out-of-the-money when the strike price is below the current trading \\nprice of the underlying security. \\nRecall that assets  have a spot price and a forward price (the price for delivery in future). One \\ncan talk about moneyness with respect to either the spot price or the forward price (at expiry): \\nthus one talks about ATMS = ATM Spot (also referred to as just at-the-money) versus ATMF = \\nATM Forward, and so forth. \\n3.2 CALL AND PUT OPTION PA YOFFS \\nCall options correspond to a bullish view on the market; a client would buy a European \\ncall when he believes the underlying stock price will be above the strike at expiry date. The \\nEuropean call payoff at T is as follows: \\nCall payoff = n × max[0, ST − K ] \\nwhere ST is the price of the underlying stock at maturity. In the example shown in Figure 3.1, \\nwe are dealing with a 1-year European call on Total struck at 52 EUR. The holder of this call \\nhas paid an initial premium equal to 450,000 EUR to get the right to buy 100,000 shares of \\nUnderlying Asset Total \\nExercise Style European \\nNumber of Shares 100,000 \\nCurrency EUR \\nInitial Spot Price 50.00 \\nStrike Price 52.00 \\nInitial Date 14/11/2008 \\nMaturity Date 14/11/2009 \\nDelivery Method Physical \\nOption Price 450,000 EUR (i.e. 4.5 EUR per share) \\nFigure 3.1 Terms of a 1-year European call option. 33 Vanilla Options \\nTotal at the strike price on 14/11/09. This means the investor has a bullish view on Total and \\nbelieves its stock price will be above 52 EUR after one year. At maturity date, if the closing \\nprice of Total shares is equal to 51 EUR, the call option will not be exercised since the ﬁnal \\nspot price of Total is below the strike. The payoff being null, the call option buyer would have \\nlost the premium paid to this contract seller. Now, what if the spot price is equal to 62 EUR on \\n14/11/09? The investor exercises his option and buys 100,000 Total shares from the call seller \\nat a price of 52 EUR per share. He can then immediately sell these shares at the market price \\n(62 EUR), realizing a proﬁt of [100, 000 × (62 − 52)] − 450, 000 = 550, 000 EUR. Note that \\nthe proﬁt and loss is computed by subtracting the premium initially paid from the payoff of the \\ncall. Here, the option buyer is bullish on the underlying stock; he could instead have chosen to \\ngo long the share itself. He would have paid 100, 000 × 50 = 5, 000, 000 EUR to buy 100,000 \\nshares of Total. Then he would have realized a potential gain of 1,200,000 EUR at maturity \\ndate, which is equivalent to 1,200,000/5,000,000 = 24% of the capital invested. Note that the \\nreturn realized from buying the call is equal to 550,000 / 450,000 = 122%. This is the reason \\nwhy call options are said to be leverage instruments; one gets a high potential payoff compared \\nto the invested capital. \\nOn the other  hand, put options correspond to a bearish view on the market; a client would \\nbuy a European put when he believes that the underlying stock price will be below the strike \\nat expiry date. The European put payoff at T is as follows: \\nPut payoff = n × max[0, K − ST ] \\nFigure 3.2 sho ws the terms of a 2-year put option contract on V odafone. The initial spot \\nprice of V odafone is equal to £1.50. In this example, a strike of 100% means that the strike \\nprice is equal to 100% of the V odafone initial spot price. Also, one can notice that the option \\nnotional is speciﬁed instead of the number of shares, because an option can be deﬁned in terms \\nof stock returns: \\nPut payoff = Put Notional × max[0, K − Perf( T )] \\nwhere K is  expressed as a percentage of the initial spot, Perf( T ) = ST /S0 is the performance \\nsince inception of V odafone at time T . Also, note that Put Notional is given by \\nPut Notional = n × S0 \\nThe buyer of this put pays a premium at the initial date equal to £2,584,500, which represents \\n17.23% of the contract notional. At the end of the second year, if the spot of V odafone is equal \\nto 102% of its initial spot, then V odafone performance is above the strike and the payoff is \\nUnderlying Asset V odafone \\nExercise Style European \\nNotional £15 million \\nCurrency GBP \\nMaturity 2 years \\nStrike 100% \\nDelivery Method Cash \\nOption Price 17.23% ( £2,584,500) \\nFigure 3.2 Terms of a 2-year European put option. 34 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n80% 20% \\n0% \\n0% 50% 100% 150% 200% \\n−20% −40% −60% \\n−80% 60% 40% 20% \\n0% \\n0% 50% 100% 150% 200% \\n−20% Profit patterns from a long call position Profit patterns from a short call position \\nProfit patterns from a long put position Profit patterns from a short put position \\n0% 50% 100% 150% 200% \\n−20% 80% 100% \\n60% 40% 20% \\n0% 20% \\n0% \\n−20% −40% −60% −80% \\n−100% 0% 50% 100% 150% 200% \\nFigure 3.3 Proﬁt patterns from trading in European call and put options. \\nnull; the put buyer would have lost all his invested capital. Now, let’s imagine Perf( T ) = 80% \\n(i.e. V odafone stock  price  at maturity is equal to £1.50 × 80% = (£1.20), then the put pays \\nthe holder an amount equal to £15, 000, 000 × (100% − 80%) = £3, 000, 000. \\nFigure 3.3 sho ws the proﬁt that can be made by buying/selling calls and puts struck at 100%. \\nNote that these graphs represent the proﬁt and not the payoff. For an option buyer, the proﬁt \\nis computed as the difference between the payoff and the premium, whereas it is equal to the \\nopposite for an option seller. \\nThe buyer of  a call can get an unlimited proﬁt, whereas the maximum loss incurred is the \\npremium paid for the option at initial date. Alternatively, selling a naked call option, where \\nDelta (see section 3.5) is not hedged, is a risky position since the seller could end up paying \\nan unlimited amount. The maximum proﬁt for bearing this risk is equal to the price of the \\ncall received at inception. On the other hand, the maximum loss and the maximum proﬁt from \\nbuying or selling a put are bounded. Indeed, in the worst case scenario, a put option buyer \\ncan lose the premium he initially paid to get a maximum potential gain equal to K − Put price, \\nwhich is lower than 100% of the underlying stock initial spot price. Conversely, the put seller \\ncould earn a maximum proﬁt equal to the option premium received and could lose a maximum \\namount equal to K − Put price. \\n3.3 PUT–CALL PARITY AND SYNTHETIC OPTIONS \\nPut–call parity speciﬁes a relationship between the prices of call and put options with the \\nidentical strike price K and expiry T . In order to derive the put–call parity relationship, we \\nmust assume that the call and put options involved are only exercised at maturity. This is, of \\ncourse, a feature of European options. Perhaps the most important feature of put–call parity \\nis that it is derived, and must be satisﬁed at all times, in a model independent manner. The 35 Vanilla Options \\nimplication of this is that irrespective of how one is pricing options, put–call parity must be \\nconserved. A violation of this leads to arbitrage opportunities as we see below. The put–call \\nparity relationship is given by: \\nCall( K ,  T ) + K e−rT = Put( K , T ) + S0e−qT \\nwhere r and q are, respectively, the risk-free rate and the dividend yield. \\nNow, let’s consider the following two portfolios to prove this result: \\n• Portfolio A.  Purchase one call option on an underlying asset S, struck at K and expiring at \\nT . Sell a put option on the same underlying, with the same strike price and maturity. \\n• Portfolio B.  Purchase a forward contract that gives the obligation to buy S at a price K at \\nmaturity date T . \\nAt maturity  date,  if ST is above K , then the call option in Portfolio A is in-the-money, whereas \\nthe put ends out-of-the-money. Portfolio A pays an amount equal to ST − K . Portfolio B pays \\nthe strategy holder ST − K no matter how the underlying stock price behaves. Moreover, if \\nST ≤ K , then the call payoff is null, whereas the put payoff is equal to K − ST .N o w ,t h e \\nholder of Portfolio A is selling the put; therefore he loses this amount. For the holder of \\nPortfolio B, the scenario is the same since he loses K − ST as the buyer of a forward contract. \\nIt follows that,  in all states, Portfolio A has the same payoff at maturity as Portfolio B. \\nFor European options, early exercise is not possible. If the values of these two portfolios are \\nthe same at the expiry of the options, then the present values of these portfolios must also be \\nthe same, otherwise, an investor can arbitrage and make a risk-free proﬁt by purchasing the \\nless expensive portfolio, selling the more expensive one and holding the long-short position \\nto maturity. Accordingly, we have the price equality: \\nCall( K ,  T ) − Put( K , T ) = Forward( K , T ) \\nand since  we  know from section 1.3.5 that \\n−qT − K e−rTForward( K , T ) = S0e\\nthrough the put–call  parity relationship, we can see that one can be long a call and short a put, \\nwith the same underlying asset, strike price and maturity, and replicate the payoff of a forward \\ncontract with the same characteristics. The position taken in Portfolio A is called a synthetic \\nunderlying position. Generally, a synthetic option is a synthetic position that is constructed \\nwithout actually buying or selling the option. By playing a bit more with the put–call parity, \\none would notice that a synthetic long call position is replicated by buying a put as well as the \\nunderlying forward. Also, a synthetic long put can be created by being long the call and short \\nthe forward. \\n3.4 BLACK–SCHOLES MODEL ASSUMPTIONS \\nIn 1973, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes published their ground-breaking paper “The pricing \\nof options and corporate liabilities” (Black and Scholes, 1973). This article contained the \\nclosed-form pricing formula for European options, now known as the Black–Scholes formula, \\nbut more importantly it described a pioneering general framework for the replication of \\nEuropean options. However, this relied on several simplifying assumptions that in practice \\nmust be given serious consideration. The initial closed form formula was only adapted to 36 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n0 \\nFigure 3.4 A log-normal distribution. \\nstocks paying zero dividends. Merton (1973) adjusted the Black–Scholes formula to enable it \\nto price European options on stocks or stock indices paying a known dividend yield. \\nThe mark et assumptions  behind the adjusted Black–Scholes formula for pricing European \\noptions on equity are as follows: \\n• The volatility of the underlying asset  is constant over time. \\n• The underlying  asset  can be traded continuously, and its price St is log-normally distributed. \\nThis means that the log-returns of S are normally distributed (Figure 3.4). \\n• One can al ways short sell the underlying stock. \\n• One does not  incur transaction costs or taxes. \\n• All securities  are  perfectly divisible, meaning that it is possible to buy any fraction of a \\nshare. \\n• One can al ways borrow and lend cash at the known risk-free interest rate r , which is assumed \\nto be constant. \\n• The stock  pays  a constant dividend yield q. \\n3.4.1 Risk-neutral Pricing  \\nThe\\n concept  of  risk neutrality comes from economics, and it is the middle point between \\nbeing risk seeking and risk averse. Consider a scenario where one has the choice between \\nreceiving 1 dollar, or receiving 2 dollars at 50% probability (meaning that there is an equal \\nchance of getting 2 dollars or receiving nothing). The risk-averse investor will choose to take \\nthe 1 dollar, whereas the risk-seeking investor will take the 2 dollars with the 50% chance. To \\nthe risk-neutral investor these two choices are equivalent, and the investor has no preference \\nbetween the two. \\nIn ﬁnance,  when  pricing an asset, a common technique is to ﬁgure out the probability of a \\nfuture cashﬂow, then discount that cashﬂow at the risk-free rate. For example, if the probability \\nof receiving 2 dollars one instant from now is 50%, the value is 1 dollar. This is called the \\nexpected value, using real-world probabilities. In the theory of risk-neutral pricing, the real-\\nworld probabilities assigned to future cashﬂows are irrelevant, and we must obtain what are \\nknown as risk-neutral probabilities. /integraldisplay 37 Vanilla Options \\nThe fundamental assumption behind risk-neutral valuation is to use a replicating portfolio \\nof assets with known prices to remove any risk. The amounts of assets needed to hedge \\ndetermine the risk-neutral probabilities. Under the aforementioned assumptions, the Black– \\nScholes theory considers options to be redundant in the sense that one can replicate the payoff \\nof a European option on a stock using the stock itself and risk-free bonds. As such, the key \\nfeature of the Black–Scholes framework is that it is preference-free: since options can be \\nreplicated, their theoretical values do not depend upon investors’ risk preferences. Therefore, \\nan option can be valued as though the return on the underlying is riskless. \\nThe risk-neutral  assumption  behind the Black–Scholes model constitutes a great advantage \\nin a trading environment. Even though one can debate whether options really are redundant, \\ngiven the nature of some market inefﬁciencies, the Black–Scholes theory of option pricing \\nstill remains the only consistent one for pricing and hedging options. \\n3.5 PRICING A EUR OPEAN CALL OPTION \\nThe price of a call option C depends on the following parameters: \\n• The underlying  spot  price S at valuation date. \\n• The volatility σ of  the underlying’s returns. \\n• The interest  rate r and the dividend yield q. \\n• The strike price  K and the time to maturity T. \\nThe Black–Scholes  formula  for a European call option is then given by \\n−qtN (d1) − Ke−rtN (d2) C = Se\\nwhere\\n \\nln(S/K) +  (r − q + σ 2/2)T √ \\nd1 = √ , d2 = d1 − σ T \\nσ T \\nand\\n N is  the standard normal cumulative distribution function \\nx \\nN (x) =√ 1e−u2 /2du \\n2π −∞ \\nThe ﬁrst thing to note is that the expected rate of the return of the underlying S does not enter \\ninto this equation. In fact the relevant parameter is the interest rate r, which is taken to be the \\nrisk-free rate of interest. \\nIf we write the forward F as  \\nF = Se(r−q)T \\nthen in the Black–Scholes formula d1 is given by \\nln(F/K) +  σ 2 T/2 d1 = √ \\nσ T \\nand the formula  becomes \\nC = e−rt[FN (d1) − KN (d2)]. \\nIn Figure  3.5,  the solid line shows the price of a 1-year European call option with respect \\nto the spot price. It is interesting to note that the curve is ascending, which makes its ﬁrst 38 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n80% 60% 40% 20% \\n0% \\n0% 50% 100% 150% \\nCall Price Call Payoff \\nFigure 3.5 Price of a 1-year European call struck at 100%. \\nderivative with respect to the spot (the Delta) positive. Also, we can see that this curve is \\nconvex, which implies the second derivative of the call price with respect to the spot (the \\nGamma) is positive. The dashed line illustrates the payoff of the European call at maturity. \\nThe payof f formula  of an option is also known as its intrinsic value . In other words, it \\nrepresents the value of exercising it now. An ITM option has positive intrinsic value – the \\ndeeper the option is in-the-money, the greater its intrinsic value – whereas an OTM option \\nhas zero intrinsic value. Figure 3.5 shows that the solid line is always above the dashed line. \\nThis positive difference between the call price and the intrinsic value is called the time value \\nof the option, which measures the uncertainty of the option ending in-the-money. It is also \\ninteresting to note that the time value for a call is always positive and reaches a maximum \\nvalue when the spot is equal to the strike price. As time to maturity decreases, the time value \\ndecreases to be equal to zero at expiry date. A call option usually loses two-thirds of its time \\nvalue during the last third of its life. We can see these points in more detail when we discuss \\noption risks in Chapter 5. \\n3.6 PRICING A EUROPEAN PUT OPTION  \\nThe Black–Scholes formula for a European put option price P is given by \\n−rt N (−d 2) − Se−qt N (−d 1) P = K  e\\nwhere d2 and d1 are as previously deﬁned. Since N (x) + N (−x) = 1 for any real number x \\n(a property of the normal CDF, illustrated in Figure 3.6), the price of a European put can also \\nbe written as follows: \\nP = Se−qt [N (d1) − 1] − K e−rt [N (d2) − 1] \\nIn Figure  3.7,  the solid line shows the price of a 1-year European put option plotted against \\nthe underlying spot price. The curve decreases when the spot goes up, which makes its ﬁrst \\nderivative with respect to the spot (the Delta) always negative. Also, we can see that this curve \\nis convex, which implies that the second derivative of the put price with respect to the spot \\n(the Gamma) is positive. The dashed line on Figure 3.7 illustrates the payoff of the European 39 Vanilla Options \\n0 x \\nFigure 3.6 The cumulative probability distribution function for a standardized Normal distribution. \\nNote that the shaded area represents N (x) which is the probability that a normally distributed variable \\nwith mean 0 and variance 1 will be lower than the value x. Because of the symmetry of the standard \\nNormal distribution, one can easily ﬁgure out that N (−x) is represented by the non-graded area. Note \\nthat the area under the bell curve is equal to 1. \\nput at maturity, or its intrinsic value. When the spot is below the strike, the put is in-the-money \\nand the intrinsic value is positive. Otherwise, it has no value. \\nMoreover, we can  see through Figure 3.7 that the time value (the difference between the put \\nprice and its intrinsic value) is not always positive. Indeed, for ITM put options, the dashed \\nline tends to be above the solid line, which implies that puts can have a negative time value. \\nThis result will also be shown when analysing the Theta of a put option in Chapter 5 on the \\nGreeks. \\n100% \\n80% 60% 40% 20% \\n0% \\n0% 50% 100% 150% \\nPut Price Put Payoff \\nFigure 3.7 Price of a 1-year European put struck at 100%. 40 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n3.7 THE COST OF HEDGING \\nWhen we discussed the Black–Scholes valuation for European options, we saw the closed \\nformulas that can be easily implemented and result in a price according to the parameters \\nplugged into the pricer. But the real questions are: Which parameters should be used to get a \\ncorrect price? And what does a correct price mean? We know that this formula is derived so that \\nthe prices it generates for an option reﬂect the cost of hedging the option. If we dynamically \\ntrade the underlying and risk-free bonds we can replicate the payoff of the option. The cost of \\nperforming this hedging must equal the price of the option. \\nWhen a trader  sells an option, he charges a premium for the risks he is bearing. Even in the \\ncase of vanilla options, the price depends on many parameters. Some of them are linked to \\nthe market; this is the case of interest rates. Other risks, such as the spot price, dividends or \\nborrowing costs, are directly related to the underlying asset itself. The strike and maturity are \\nspeciﬁc to the option’s terms. The volatility to be used is known as the implied volatility of the \\nasset, and in the case of vanilla options is known in the market; this is the subject of discussion \\nof Chapter 4. These parameters can be used in the Black–Scholes formula to obtain the prices \\nof vanilla options, but for more complicated payoffs we may not have closed formulas that \\ndirectly reﬂect the cost of hedging. As we move to more complicated options we must keep in \\nmind that the cost of an option should reﬂect the cost of hedging the risks it entails. \\nWe understand  that,  unlike many other commercial products, ﬁnancial instruments are \\nessentially produced after they are sold. They are not necessarily hedged to replication as this \\nis typically not possible, but they are hedged to risk exposures that are tolerable. There are \\nmany risks to be understood, managed and priced into the ask and bid prices of structured \\nproducts. Exact replication is, however, unlikely and we need to determine how one may \\nmake the holding of the residual an acceptable risk. Traders quote bid and ask prices that \\ncorrespond respectively to the price they are willing to pay/receive for buying/selling a ﬁnancial \\nproduct. \\nOf course,  the  fewer the set of risks that are acceptable, the wider is the bid–ask spread \\nand the less likely that there is a trading counterparty for any particular product. In other \\nwords, the traders charge a lower premium as well as a small bid–ask spread if they feel \\ncomfortable hedging the risks associated with trading in a speciﬁc option. Hence a proposed \\nproduct coming from a tailored customer request must be analysed for the risks associated \\nwith its issue. One may then determine strategies to control the risk exposure and the likely \\ncosts of doing so. The latter can then be built into the price. We will also see in Chap-\\nter 5 the  interplay between the option risks and how a trader can make money through \\nhedging. \\nExercise Consider a stock\\n  Alpha that can take two speciﬁc values 70 and 120 after 5 years. Alpha’s \\ninitial spot is equal to 100. The equity analysts covering this stock and working for a major \\nﬁnancial institution state that there is a 60% probability that the ﬁnal spot price will be 120 \\nand a 40% probability that the ﬁnal spot ends at 70. Then, what would be the fair price of \\na 5-year European at-the-money call option on Alpha? To keep things simple, let’s assume \\nthat interest rates and dividends are both zero. /braceleftbigg 41 Vanilla Options \\n120 \\n70 100 \\nd = 40% u = 60% \\nDiscussion Since interest  rates\\n  and dividends are assumed to be null, the price of the call is equal to \\nthe expected value of the stock minus the strike (that is equal to 100). If one thinks that the \\nexpected value of the stock at maturity is equal to 120 × 60% + 70 × 40% = 100, then he \\nis deﬁnitely lost. The price of the call would have been equal to 100 − 100 = 0. One could \\nuse probabilities if we are working in a risk-neutral environment, which is not the case of \\nthe real world. Therefore, these probabilities are useless in our pricing. \\nFirstly, the price  of an option represents the cost of the hedge. Let’s assume that you are \\nshort the call, then you have to be long a number /Delta1 of stocks in order not to be sensitive to \\nthe spot price (options sensitivities are fully covered in Chapter 5 on Greeks). In this case, \\nyour P&L is always equal to zero no matter what happens to the stock price. \\n120 \\nP&L = −20 + 20∆ + C = 0 \\n100 \\n70 \\nP&L = 0 \\n− 30∆ + C \\nLet C denote the call premium that you received at start date. If the stock price ﬁnishes \\nat 120, then the call is exercised and you have to pay 20 to the option’s holder. On the \\nother hand, you realized a proﬁt of 20/Delta1 from your stock position. Alternatively, if the ﬁnal \\nstock price is equal to 70, then the call is not exercised but you lose 30/Delta1 on your stock \\nposition. \\nSince the P&L is null in all cases, we have to solve the following system: \\n−20 + 20 /Delta1 + C = 0 \\n0 − 30/Delta1 + C = 0 \\nThis gives us /Delta1  = 40% and C = 12, which answers our question. 42 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n3.8 AMERICAN OPTIONS \\nAmerican options can be exercised at any time during their life. Since investors have the \\nfreedom to exercise their American options at any point during the life of the contract, they \\nare more valuable than European options which can only be exercised at maturity. This extra \\nfeature implies: \\nCA(t, K , T ) ≥ CE(t, K , T ) \\nwhere CA(t, K , T ) and CE(t, K , T ) are respectively the prices at time t of an American and \\nEuropean call with strike K and maturity T .A n d \\nPA(t, K , T ) ≥ PE(t, K , T ) \\nwhere PA(t, K , T ) and PE(t, K , T ) are, respectively, the prices at time t of an American and \\na European put with strike K and maturity T . \\nNow, is there  an optimal timing to exercise American options? And, if so, what does it \\ndepend on? To answer these crucial questions linked to trading in American options, we \\nﬁrst have to establish some important formulas. To do so, let’s consider the following two \\nportfolios: \\n• Portfolio A.  Purchase an underlying asset S.L e t D denote the future value at time T of its \\ndividend payments. \\n• Portfolio B. Purchase  one European call option on the underlying asset S, struck at K and \\nexpiring at T . Make a bank deposit equal to [ D + K ]e−rT invested at the risk-free rate r . \\nAt date T  , the holder of Portfolio A would have received a total amount equal to ST + D. \\nIf ST is above K , then the call option in Portfolio B is in-the-money and pays ST − K .A n d \\nsince the deposit amount (D + K )e−rT redeems at D + K , then Portfolio B pays an amount \\nequal to ST − K + D + K = ST + D. Moreover, if ST ≤ K , then the call payoff is null and \\nPortfolio B pays D + K , whereas Portfolio A pays D + ST (lower than D + K ). It follows \\nthat, in all states, Portfolio A has a payoff at maturity lower than or equal to the payoff of \\nPortfolio B. Therefore, holding Portfolio A is cheaper than holding Portfolio B. In the absence \\nof an arbitrage opportunity, we get the following result: \\nCE + [D + K ]e−rT ≥ S0 \\nand since an American call is more expensive than a European call with the same strike and \\nmaturity, this implies that \\n−r (T −t ) − K e−r (T −t )CA(t, K , T ) ≥ St − De\\nAt any time  t during the life of the American option, one would exercise his option if its value \\nis lower than the payoff he would receive, i.e. if \\nSt − K > CA(t, K , T ) \\nwhich leads  to  \\n−r (T −t) − K e−r (T −t)St − K > St − De\\nor, equivalently, \\n−r (T −t)) D > K  × (1 − e43 Vanilla Options \\nAnd since (1 − e−r (T −t )) can be approximated by r (T − t) to ﬁrst order, this implies that \\nD > r (T  − t)K \\nTherefore, if the  formula above is veriﬁed at any time t, this means that it is optimal to \\nexercise the American call. Intuitively now, if one exercises the American call, he pays a \\nspeciﬁc amount of money to buy the underlying shares. On the one hand, he doesn’t receive \\ninterest on this cash amount; and, on the other, he would receive future dividends for holding \\nthe stocks. In other words, if the dividend yield is higher than the interest rate until maturity, it \\nis optimal to exercise the American call; and this is what the formula above emphasizes. Also \\nnote that for stocks not paying dividends, it is never optimal to exercise the American call. \\nUltimately, it can be optimal for the holder of an American put option to choose to exercise \\nif the interest rate that would be received on a cash deposit equal to K is higher than the \\ndividend payments until maturity. In particular, for non-dividend-paying stocks, an American \\nput should always be exercised when it is sufﬁciently deep in-the-money. This result can be \\nillustrated in the same way as we did for American call options. \\n3.9 ASIAN OPTIONS \\nAn Asian option is a derivative with a payoff at maturity date T based on the average \\nperformance Saverage of the underlying recorded at different dates against the initial date during \\nthe product life. An Asian call option is a European style call (bullish view) that has the \\nfollowing payoff at maturity T , based on the average Saverage given by \\nAsian Call payoff = max[0, Saverage − K ] \\nwhere K is  the strike price. Conversely, an Asian put is a European style put option (bearish \\nview) that gives the holder the following payoff at maturity T : \\nAsian Put payoff = max[0 , K − Saverage ] \\nSince the payof f of Asian options is based on the average of the underlying asset prices during \\nthe term of the product, the uncertainty concerning the ﬂuctuations of the underlying price \\nat maturity decreases. Therefore, the risk exposure to the spot price and volatility is lower \\nfor an Asian option compared to a regular European option. Also, the higher the number of \\nobservations, the lower the price of the option. \\nThe averaging periods  can be uniform during the life of the option, i.e. the structure can \\ntake many forms including weekly, monthly, quarterly or annual averagings from inception to \\nmaturity date. These Asian options are said to be averaging-in style. For instance, a 2-year \\nat-the-money Asian call averaging-in quarterly is a call paying the positive average of the eight \\nunderlying returns observed at the end of each quarter throughout the term of the product. Asian \\noptions can also be averaging-out style, which means that the average is computed during a \\nspeciﬁc period near the maturity date. A 2-year 90% Asian call averaging-out monthly during \\nthe last year is an out-of-the-money put struck at 90% and for which the average price of the \\nspot is based on the underlying spot closing prices observed during the last 12 months of the \\nproduct’s life. \\nIn the general  case, averaging-in style options are less risky than averaging-out Asian \\noptions. Indeed, the uncertainty about future spot prices is lower when the average is computed \\nperiodically since inception date. In the case of averaging-out style Asian options, the future 44 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nspot prices would have a higher impact on the option’s value, thus increasing the risk exposure \\nto spot price and volatility. \\nMoreover, there  are  many ways to compute the average of the stock returns. Indeed, Saverage \\ncan be a geometric or arithmetic average. In the case of a geometric average, it is possible \\nto ﬁnd analytical formulas for pricing Asian call and put options. This is due to the fact that \\nthe geometric average of log-normal variables is log-normally distributed in the risk-neutral \\nworld. A good approximation for the price of an average option is given in Kemna and V orst \\n(1990) where the geometric average option is priced using Black–Scholes closed formulas, √ \\nwith the growth rate (r − q)s e t t o (r − q − σ2/6)/2, and the volatility set to σ/ 3.\\nHowever, in most  of the cases, the average of the underlying asset prices is arithmetic, \\nand there are no closed formulas for pricing arithmetic average options since the arithmetic \\naverage of log-normal variables is not log-normal. Bearing in mind that the distribution of this \\narithmetic average is nearly log-normal, good approximations of the Asian option prices are \\navailable in the literature. (e.g. Kemna and V orst, 1990). In general, one will simply obtain the \\nimplied volatility of the option implied from vanilla derivatives, and perform a Monte Carlo \\nsimulation of a log-normal process using this volatility, where the paths are simulated to reﬂect \\nthe period over which the averaging is taking place. \\n3.10 AN EXAMPLE OF THE STRUCTURING PROCESS \\nIn this section we apply what we have learned so far regarding structures in Chapter 2, making \\nuse of section 2.5 regarding the equity linked note, with what we have seen in this chapter on \\nvanilla options. \\n3.10.1 Capital Protection and Equity  Participation \\nAssume that an  investor is interested in gaining equity exposure, but does not want to risk \\ncapital. A simple note structure as described in Figure 2.1 (page 21) is a good starting point. \\nIf we assume that we are looking at a 4-year maturity, then to guarantee that the capital is \\nreturned at 100% we set aside a percentage of capital to put into a zero coupon bond that will \\npay 100% of the notional at maturity. Taking interest rates to be 3%, plus a funding spread of \\n35 bp per annum, we have a bond price of 87.46%, leaving us with 100% − 87.46% = 12.54% \\nof the notional to spend on the option. Let’s take 54 bp of P&L, then we are left with 12.00% \\nto put into an option that offers equity exposure. \\nStarting with the  vanilla options we have seen here, the easiest choice is to spend this on \\na call option. Depending on the investor’s preference, let’s take one of the global indices, for \\nexample the EuroStoxx50, and try to use an ATM call option. Pricing a 4-year ATM call option \\non EuroStoxx50 gives us an option price of 15%, and we run into our ﬁrst problem. We only \\nhave 12.00% to spend on the equity part of the note, and an ATM call option is too expensive. \\nThe ﬁrst possibility  is to offer a participation rate of less than 100%. A participation rate \\nof 100% would mean that the investor will receive, on the equity part of the note, a return \\nexactly equal to any increase in the price of the index from the start date to the expiry of the \\noption. For example, if the index rose by 27%, the return will also be 27%. Obviously there \\nis no downside risk here as the call option has a minimum payoff of 0%, because if the index \\nhas a negative return during the period under consideration, the call option is not exercised \\nand the payoff is zero. The bond still pays 100% and the investor’s money is secure. To write /bracketleftbigg /bracketrightbigg \\n/bracketleftbigg /bracketrightbigg \\n/bracketleftbigg /bracketrightbigg \\n/bracketleftbigg /bracketrightbigg 45 Vanilla Options \\nthis in the form of a payoff we have \\nIndex( T )  − Index(0) Note payoff = 100% + max 0%, Index(0) \\nIn our present  case, since we have only 12% to spend, but the ATM call option costs 15%, \\nwe could offer a lowered participation rate, also known as gearing , of 80%. This means \\nthat the upside is now 80% of any increase in the index, and this will cost the structurer \\n80% × Price of ATM call = 80% × 15% = 12%. Solving for the gearing in a case like this, \\none can simply divide the amount available to spend on the option by the option price. So, \\n12%/15% = 80% is where we get the 80% participation. In this case, the participation in the \\nindex return of 27% would in fact be \\n27% × P articipation = 27% × 80% = 21.60% \\nand the payof f would be \\nIndex( T )  − Index(0) Note payoff = 100% + 80% × max 0%, Index(0) \\nNow as such,  the investor may ﬁnd that taking a participation rate of less than 100% is not \\nappealing. Keep in mind that the investor has the option to simply place his money into the \\nsame bond with no equity exposure and, assuming the same interest rates used to compute the \\nbond price above, has the potential to earn 3.35% annually. In this case we turn to our second \\npossibility, which is to introduce some form of averaging. Starting at the end and working \\nbackwards, we can try taking the call option on the average of the index price over the last 3 \\nmonths of the maturity. This will reduce the price as discussed above in the context of Asian \\nor average options. If this is not enough to bring the price down to the amount available for \\nthe equity part of the note, then the structurer can try further averaging (last 6 months, last 9 \\nmonths, last 12 months) to get the prices to ﬁt. Again, too much averaging may not appeal \\nto the investor; although a 4-year maturity with the last 12 months averaged out is not too \\noutrageous. \\nOn the other  hand, if interest rates were higher and we had more to put into the equity part \\nof the note than the cost of the ATM call, we can increase the participation and have a gearing \\ngreater than 100%. This would also ﬁt into the scenario where rates are relatively high and \\nthe investor, although bullish on an equity index, may want to receive a minimum guaranteed \\ncoupon. Taking the same 4-year maturity, assume that the investor is willing to forgo putting \\nall the money into a bond, in exchange for some equity participation, but wants to earn at \\nleast 5% at maturity in addition to the 100% guaranteed capital. This means that redemption \\nat maturity is given by the payoff \\nIndex( T )  − Index(0) Note payoff = 100% + max 5%, Index(0) \\nand, as such,  will receive back at least 105% of the notional. To see the breakdown of the \\npayoff on the right-hand side, we subtract the 5% to get \\nIndex( T )  − Index(0) Note payoff = 105% + max 0%, − 5% Index(0) /bracketleftbigg /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg 46 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nand we notice that the right-hand side is an OTM call option, at the OTM strike of 5%. The \\nOTM call option will need to be correctly priced and the structure as such now includes a \\nminimum guarantee of 5%. \\nYet another  w ay to cheapen the equity part to ﬁt into a note is to introduce a cap into the \\npayoff. \\nIndex( T )  − Index(0) Note payoff = 100% + max 0%, min , CapIndex(0) \\nwhere the payof f is computed on the basis of a prespeciﬁed cap that essentially caps the \\nunlimited upside in the call option thus making the structure cheaper. As such, this structure \\nbreaks down into what is known as a call spread, which is discussed in detail in later chapters. \\n3.10.2 Capital at Risk  and Higher Participation \\nLet’s now consider  the case where the investor is willing to take on some downside risk in \\nexchange for enhanced participation in the upside. Following the note construction as before, \\nassume now that the investor is willing to put 3% of his capital at risk. In this case the \\ninvestor has 100% − 3% = 97% guaranteed capital, and we then put part of the notional \\ninto a bond that pays 97% at maturity instead of the 100% above. If we have the same \\nparameters as in the ﬁrst example in this section, the bond is only worth 84.83%, which leaves \\n100% − 84.83% = 15.17% for the structurer to spend on the option. As this covers the cost \\nof the ATM call option of 15%, no additional gearing or averaging is needed. \\nAnother example, and  one which combines put options as well as call options, can be \\nstructured by offering the investor participation in the upside through a call option, and some \\nparticipation in the downside through a put option. In all the above examples the bank sells \\nthe investor one of the call options of the above forms; consider the case where the seller adds \\na put option such that the investor is short the put option. Recall that the put option pays when \\nthe underlying ends below the strike, so if the investor is short the put option then she has \\ncapital at risk in the event the index ends below its starting level (assuming the put is struck \\nATM). \\nAs such,  in  addition to the 12.00% to spend on the equity part of the note (following the \\nsame numbers as the start of the section) then, in addition, we have the premium from the put \\noption. Let’s assume that the ATM put option costs 17% and the investor is willing to take \\n50% participation in the downside in exchange for increased participation in the upside. Then \\nthe seller of the structure has 50% × 17% = 8.5% excess to offer upside in the equity. In total \\nthis gives 12% + 8.5% = 20.5%, and since the ATM call is worth 15% then the participation \\nin the upside can now be increased to 20.5%/15% = 170.83%. So, in exchange for accepting \\na potential downside risk at 50% of any downturn in the index value, the investor now gets a \\nfar greater participation than 100% in the upside. \\nAdding different types  of put options to enhance the payouts of various structures is a \\ncommon technique. A key point is that although this can signiﬁcantly enhance the upside \\npotential in even a simple structure such as this, in the event of a market crash the investor’s \\ncapital is not protected. The payoff at maturity of the combined long position in the geared \\ncall option and short position in the geared put option is depicted in Figure 3.8. \\nAn important  point  here is that although this section describes the process of combining the \\nconcepts we have seen so far, one must keep in mind that when a bank sells a call option it \\nis in fact selling volatility. If a bank sells a call option and volatility goes up, then the value 47 Vanilla Options \\n125% 100% \\n75% \\n50% \\n25% \\n0% \\n−25% \\n−\\n50% 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% \\n170% geared call 50% geared put −75% \\nFigure 3.8 A combination of 50% participation in the downside (put) and 170% participation in the \\nupside (call). \\nof the call option goes up, and thus the seller of the call option is short volatility. So, in an \\nenvironment where volatility is high, the value of a call option will also be high in comparison \\nwith a lower volatility environment, and the prices offered on such a structure will not be \\nappealing. In cases such as these, there are more suitably ﬁtted structures one can use to obtain \\nequity exposure, but where the seller of the instrument is able to buy volatility. As we go along, \\nobserving the volatility position of each product is key in understanding the environment for \\nwhich it is best suited, and in doing so one can know which structures would offer the most \\nappealing deals to investors. The last example, involving the addition of the put option, is one \\nsuch case, because the put option’s price also increases with volatility and since the seller of \\nthe structure is buying the put, he is buying volatility through the put. More complex structures \\nthan those described here will be seen throughout the book. The process described serves as \\na good example of combining an investor’s requirements with price constraints, and that the \\nonly real limit is the structurer’s imagination. /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg \\n/summationdisplay \\n/summationdisplay 4 \\nV olatility, Skew and Term Structure  \\nHuman behavior ﬂows from three main sources: desire, emotion, and knowledge. \\nPlato \\nIn this chapter we study the concept of volatility; speciﬁcally we discuss realized and implied \\nvolatility, their meanings, measurements, uses and limitations. This leads us to the discussion \\nof the implied volatility skew and the term structure of implied volatility. We end the chapter \\nwith a non-technical treatment of various models that capture the different forms of volatility \\nand skew and, accordingly, understand the models’ uses. Interesting discussions regarding the \\nimplied volatility surface appear in the literature, including Derman (1999), Derman and Kani \\n(2004), Dupire (1994) and Gatheral (2006). \\n4.1 VOLATILITY \\nOne must distinguish between realized volatility and implied volatility of an asset. Both give \\nus information about the asset, and although they are related, they are different concepts. The \\nrealized volatility of an asset is the statistical measure we know as the standard deviation. The \\nimplied volatility of the same asset, on the other hand, is the volatility parameter that one can \\ninfer from the prices of traded options written on this asset. \\n4.1.1 Realized Volatility \\nRealized\\n volatility, also  known as statistical volatility or historical volatility, is a measurement \\nof how much the price of the asset has changed during a period of time. Often, volatility \\nis taken to be the standard deviation of the movements in the price. Given a set of N price \\nobservations S(t1),S(t2),..., S(tN ), one would deﬁne the continuously compounded return ri \\nbetween time ti−1 and ti as \\nS(ti ) ri = ln S(ti−1) \\nthen an unbiased  estimate of the variance of the price returns on day tN is \\n1 N \\n2σtN = (rN −i − r¯)2 \\nN − 1 i=1 \\nwhere r¯is the mean of the returns ri given by \\n1 N \\nr¯= rN −iN i=1 /summationdisplay 50 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nThis can be modiﬁed in several ways: ﬁrstly, the returns can be computed as a percentage \\nreturn \\nS(ti ) − S(ti −1) ri = S(ti−1) \\nthe mean  return  ¯r is assumed to be zero, and N − 1 is replaced by N . As pointed out by Hull \\n(2003), these three changes make little difference to the variance estimates, yet simplify the \\nvariance formula to \\n1 N \\n2 2σtN = rN −iN i=1 \\nThe standard deviation σtN is the square root of the variance. The volatility of the process at \\ntime t − 1 is deﬁned as the standard deviation of the time t return. Clients can freely specify \\nthe period over which they want to look at the realized volatility, and the frequency of price \\nobservations (provided price data for such observations exist), although often volatility is \\ncomputed using the daily closing prices of the asset over a year, which is referred to as the \\nannualized standard deviation.1 The results from computing realized volatility with different \\nunits of time must be interpreted correctly. Over one day, the standard deviation in the price of \\nan asset may be 1.5%, and over a year it may be 24%, so there is therefore a need to specify the \\nvolatility that is being selected. When no time frame is explicitly speciﬁed, the phrase “stock \\nA has a volatility of 24%” generally means that stock A has an annual standard deviation \\nof 24%. \\nBoth volatility and  variance are useful measurements with each having its own advantages. \\nFor example, volatility as a standard deviation is a good measurement of the price variability \\nof an asset because it is expressed in the same units as the price data, thus making it easier to \\ninterpret. Along the lines of standard convention, volatility is deﬁned as above and in cases \\nwhen variance is used this will be speciﬁed. \\nWhen one thinks  of volatility, i.e. realized volatility, the higher this is the riskier the asset \\nsince a high volatility means that the asset has had greater price ﬂuctuations in the recent past. \\nA higher volatility means more uncertainty about the size of an asset’s ﬂuctuations and, as \\nsuch, it can be considered a measurement of uncertainty. \\nV olatility is dynamic  and changes a great deal over time for numerous reasons. A property \\nthat is observed in a time series of realized volatility is that it experiences high and low \\nregimes, but that it also has a long-term mean to which it reverts. Another characteristic is \\nthat, as a stock market witnesses a large decline, volatility shoots up: we therefore generally \\nsee a negative correlation between such assets and their volatilities. \\nCaution must  be  taken when interpreting the meaning of a certain volatility. Since realized \\nvolatility is obtained from a set of price data one must be sure that the period over which \\nvolatility is computed is not biased towards one regime or another. Also, although looking at \\npast data can give an idea of how the price of an asset has behaved, many factors are always at \\nplay and the results from past data as such are not necessarily an accurate indication of future \\nprice ﬂuctuations. \\n1 Daily volatilities are annualized by using the square root of time rule. Be careful, an annual volatility is different \\nto an annualized volatility. 51 V olatility, Ske w and Term Structure \\nIn Chapter 16, on volatility derivatives, we see derivatives such as volatility and variance \\nswaps with payoffs that are explicitly dependent on the volatility realized by an asset. \\n4.1.2 Implied Volatility \\nThe realized  v olatility of an asset, as just seen, is a measure of how the asset’s price ﬂuctuated \\nover a speciﬁc period of time. It is also called historical volatility because it reﬂects the past; \\nhowever, it does not necessarily contain information about the current market sentiment. The \\nimplied volatility of an asset on the other hand, as the name suggests, is a representative of \\nwhat the market is implying in terms of volatility. \\nIf one looks  at the prices of liquidly traded instruments, such as vanilla options, one can \\nextract an implied volatilit y–av o l a tility that corresponds to these prices. Using the Black– \\nScholes formula, any given price corresponds to one and only one volatility parameter. In fact \\nvanilla options are quoted in terms of their implied volatilities since this, or a given price, \\nessentially amounts to the same information. Take an asset and look at the market’s prices of \\ncalls and puts written on this asset: for each asset one can know the volatility that corresponds \\nto the price of each option – the implied volatility. \\nAn asset  may  have a realized volatility, based on its past performance given by σrealized , \\ncomputed today, as described above, and this gives us information about the ﬂuctuations of \\nthe underlying during the past period over which this volatility is computed. But, one may \\ntake a look, today, at the prices of liquidly traded options on the same asset, with maturities in \\nthe future, and infer an implied volatility. Since these instruments are based on the market’s \\nperception of their true value, one can see the volatility of the asset that the market is inferring. \\nThe two volatilities do not necessarily coincide, and although they may be close, they are \\ntypically not equal. \\nThe liquidity  of  such options means that supply and demand indicate that their prices are \\nthe market’s consensus of the correct price. This means that the volatilities extracted from \\nthese option prices are in fact the market’s consensus on the forward looking volatility of the \\nasset. This implied volatility incorporates the forward views on all market participants on the \\nasset’s volatility. \\nUsing the correct  implied volatility of an asset allows one to price other derivatives on \\nthe asset, in particular those that are not liquidly traded. To price an exotic derivative, the \\nvolatilities used must be those that reﬂect the market’s current view on the volatility of the \\nasset. In particular, when a European option serves as a hedging instrument for a more exotic \\noption, its associated implied volatility is of relevance to the pricing and hedging of the exotic \\noption. We go into more depth below to study the properties of implied volatility, and the last \\nsection of the chapter discusses (a) the different models that capture the various characteristics \\nof implied volatility and (b) when we need each of these models. \\nWhere the implied  volatility of an asset cannot be implied from traded instruments, one \\nmay resort to using the realized volatility as a proxy for implied volatility to get an idea \\nof what volatility would be correct to use. This is discussed in the context of volatility \\nsensitivities and hedging in Chapter 5. In contrast, the realized volatility of an asset can \\nbe used as a sanity check to ensure that the implied volatilities being used make sense. \\nThe two are different, with implied volatility generally being higher than realized volatility, \\nbut too far a spread could imply a mistake, or if correct, an arbitrage opportunity. Trad-\\ning the spread  between these two is discussed as a strategy in Chapter 16 on volatility \\nderivatives. 52 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n40% 30% 20% 10% \\n0% \\n70% 80% 90% 100% 110% 120% 130% \\nConstant volatility Implied volatility skew \\nFigure 4.1 An implied volatility skew across strikes versus a ﬂat volatility which is constant across \\nstrikes. \\n4.2 THE VOLATILITY SURFACE \\nThe volatility surface, which, to be precise, is really the implied volatility surface, is the three-\\ndimensional surface obtained when one plots the market implied volatilities of European \\noptions with different strikes and different maturities. By ﬁxing a maturity and looking at \\nthe implied volatilities of European options on the same underlying but different strikes, we \\nobtain what is known as the implied volatility skew or smile, depending on its shape, typically \\nspeciﬁc to the asset class. Fixing a strike, usually the ATM strike, of options on the same \\nunderlying and looking at their implied volatilities, we see what is known as the term structure \\nof volatilities. \\n4.2.1 The Implied  V olatility Skew \\nEuropean options  of  the same maturity on the same underlying have implied volatilities that \\nvary with strike, for example, the 80% OTM put has a different implied volatility to the ATM \\nput. Plotting these implied volatilities across strikes gives us the implied volatility skew, also \\nreferred to as volatility skew, or even just skew. Although the volatility skew is dynamic, in \\nequity markets it is almost always a decreasing function of strike. Other asset classes such as \\nFX and commodities have differently shaped skews and we will see these in detail in Chapters \\n17 and 18 when we discuss these asset classes separately. To say there is a skew means that \\nEuropean options with low strikes have higher implied volatilities than those with higher \\nstrikes. Figure 4.1 gives an example of an implied volatility skew across strikes and a ﬂat, i.e. \\nconstant, volatility also for comparison. \\nIn Figure  4.1  the ATM volatility is the same in both, given by the square above the 100% \\nstrike (ATM). The implied volatility of OTM puts, whose strikes are below the ATM level, \\nhave higher implied volatilities in the presence of skew. The two dots on the graph are the \\nimplied volatilities of the 80% strike puts under ﬂat volatility and skew; notice the difference \\nbetween them. Also notice that OTM call options, i.e. call options whose strikes are above the 53 V olatility, Ske w and Term Structure \\nATM level, have lower implied volatilities in the presence of skew compared to a ﬂat volatility \\nassumption. \\nThere are se veral reasons for the existence of this implied volatility skew. Implied volatility \\nis the market’s consensus on the volatility of the asset between now and the maturity of the \\noption. Put options pay on the downside and are thus good hedging instruments against market \\ncrashes. If an asset drops in price, this is generally accompanied by an increase in its volatility. \\nIn this case fear manifests itself because of the increased uncertainty and risk involved in \\nsuch a drop. This is reﬂected in the implied volatilities of the OTM puts being higher than the \\nOTM calls because puts pay on the downside. The market tends to consider a large downward \\nmove in an asset to be more probable than a large upward move, and so options with strikes \\nbelow current levels will hold a higher implied volatility. A downward jump also increases \\nthe possibility of another such move, again reﬂected by higher volatilities. Additionally, one \\ncan discuss the leverage effect: a leverage increase given by a decline in the ﬁrm’s stock price, \\nwith debt levels unchanged, generally results in higher levels of equity volatility. \\nAs we will  see in Chapter 5 on option sensitivities (the Greeks), call and put options have a \\npositive sensitivity to volatility. This means that as their implied volatility goes up, their price \\ngoes up, and vice versa. This also means that the seller of a call or put is essentially selling \\nvolatility (and conversely for the buyer of a call or put). Since the values of these vanillas \\ncome from the implied volatility, the higher premium imposed upon the OTM puts over the \\nOTM calls is reﬂected in the skew. \\nAlso, as we  will see in the chapter on Greeks, large costs can be involved in hedging OTM \\nputs when the market is in decline. Higher hedging costs are reﬂected in increased premiums \\nfor downside options, and this is reﬂected in the skew where such puts are priced with a higher \\nimplied volatility. \\nMeasuring and T rading the Implied Skew \\nThe ﬁrst thing  in measuring the skew is to note its level, which is given by the ATM implied \\nvolatility. The skew can vary in shape, but the ATM volatility tells us where it is located, i.e. \\nh o wh i g hi ti s . T h ew o r d skew is also used to refer to the slope of the implied volatility skew. \\nAlthough the curve is not a straight line, the concept of being more skewed means that it is \\ngenerally steeper (see Figure 4.2). This slope is negative since the implied volatilities are a \\ndecreasing function of strike and thus equity markets are often said to have a negative skew. \\nHow much  sk ew there is – generally as a measure of how steep the curve is – can be seen \\nby computing the slope of the implied volatilities with respect to the strike. Assuming we had \\nthe set of implied volatilities as a function of strike σImplied (K ), then the slope is given by the \\nﬁrst derivative, at a speciﬁc point, possibly the ATM point \\nSlope = dσImplied (K ) (4.1)dK \\nIn\\n reality, however, we only have implied volatilities for a discrete set of strikes. One can use \\nsome form of interpolation to obtain the function σImplied (K ) in order to have a parametric \\nform, but in practice, and to have a standard method of measuring skew, we take the difference \\nbetween the implied volatilities of the 90% and 100% strike vanillas. These two points form \\na straight line and its slope with respect to the strike axis (the x-axis) tells us how negatively \\nskewed the implied volatilities are. To actually get the value of the slope we would need to \\ndivide by the difference of the strikes, 100% − 90% = 10%, as this is the ﬁrst-order ﬁnite 54 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n40% 30% 20% 10% \\n0% \\n75% 80% 85% \\n90% 95% 100% 105% 110% 115% 120% \\nSkew 1 Skew 2 Skew 3 \\nFigure 4.2 Three implied volatility skews. The ATM volatilities are the same in all the volatility skews. \\nThe 90% − 100% skew (slope) of implied skew 3 is twice as steep as implied skew 1. \\ndifference approximation to the derivative in equation (4.1).2 In Figure 4.2 note the three cases: \\nthe ATM volatility is the same, but they all have different skews. The 90%−100% skews are \\ngiven by 0.4574, 0.7032 and 0.9148 respectively, here quoted as positive numbers (the absolute \\nvalues) which is often done when it is assumed that the equity skew is always negative. \\nThe reason  for  comparing the 90% strike (and not the 110% strike) with the 100% strike \\nto quantify the skew, is because the downside skew (put skew) is more severe, and it also \\nhas implications that we will discuss later in Chapter 16 on volatility derivatives. Another \\npossibility is to parameterize using the 90% and the 110% strikes, instead of the 90% and \\nATM points. \\nIf one belie ves the skew to be steeper (or ﬂatter) than it should be, one way to take this view \\nis to sell (or buy) a put spread (this is the combination of two puts with different strikes). Since \\nthe put option has a positive sensitivity to volatility (that is, as volatility increases, its price \\nincreases) the buyer of the put is therefore buying volatility, and the seller of the put is selling \\nvolatility. This sensitivity to volatility is referred to as Vega and is discussed in Chapter 5. \\nThe level of volatility at which the buyer (or seller) of the put is buying (selling) is the correct \\nimplied volatility at the relevant strike. So, by selling a 90% strike put, and buying the ATM \\nput, giving the long position in the 90–100% put spread, the investor has sold the 90% strike \\nimplied volatility and bought the ATM volatility. If in fact the skew was steeper than it should \\nhave been and the market begins to imply a ﬂatter skew, the volatility of the 90% strike put \\nwill be lower and thus its price is lower, making the price of the put spread higher. The holder \\nof the put spread is said to be short skew, in the sense that if skew increases, the put spread’s \\nvalue decreases. Alternatively, the seller of the put spread is long skew. In Figure 4.2 notice \\nthat the less steep skew carries lower OTM put volatilities. More details on call spreads and \\nput spreads are discussed in Chapter 6 on options strategies. \\nf (x)− f (x −h) 2 A ﬁrst order approximation to the derivative of a function f at the point x is given by h 55 V olatility, Ske w and Term Structure \\nIf we compare the implied volatility skews of an index and that of a stock we ﬁnd that index \\nvolatilities are more skewed than those of a single stock. The reason for this is that if stocks \\nare all dropping during a market decline, the realized correlation between them rises, and an \\nequity index is a weighted average of different stocks. We see this further when discussing \\nrealized correlation in Chapter 7. \\nThis is a  useful property as one can use the skew of an index as a proxy for pricing \\nskew-dependent payoffs on stocks whose implied skews are not as liquid as those of the \\nindex. For an index we are often able to ﬁnd liquid quotes for options of different strikes, \\nbut for single stocks we typically ﬁnd less liquidity in the options market on these stocks. \\nKnowing that the index’s implied volatilities are more skewed than those of the single stock, \\nit is possible to take a percentage of the index skew and use this in the pricing. This is \\nespecially relevant if options on the index will be used in the volatility hedging of another \\noption. Consider an asset for which we have ATM implied volatilities from the market but \\nfew OTM quotes: we can use the ATM volatility to specify the correct level of the implied \\nvolatility skew and then use a percentage (for example, 80%) of the index’s skew as a proxy \\nfor the stock’s skew. What percentage to use is primarily a function of whether the structure \\nin question sets the seller short skew or long skew, and from there it is a function of how \\naggressive or conservative the trader wants to be on the skew position. For example, one \\nmay use a banking stock index’s skew as the skew proxy for a basket option on banking \\nstocks. This can prove handy when we introduce multi-asset options where, for example, \\nwe may have a skew-dependent payoff on a basket of stocks which we will see in detail in \\nChapters 7, 8 and 9 on correlation and dispersion, and also in Chapter 21 when constructing \\nindices. Measuring and T\\n rading the Implied Skew’s Convexity \\nAnother measure  that  gives us information about the skew is its convexity. This is also known \\nas the curvature of the implied volatility skew. To quantify this, one can consider a combination \\nof the implied volatilities of vanillas with strikes at 90%, 100% and 110%. The sum of the \\n90% and the 110% implied volatilities minus twice the 100% strike volatility and dividing by \\nthe difference in strikes squared (that is, (110% − 100%)2 = (10%)2), gives us the measure \\nof the implied skew’s convexity.3,4 We need two points to measure the skew and three points \\nto measure convexity. The more convex the implied volatility skew is, the more rapidly the \\nvolatilities grow as the strikes decrease (see Figure 4.3). In fact the combination of vanillas with \\nthe above strikes is known as a butterﬂy spread , discussed in Chapter 6 on option strategies. \\nThe reason  such  a trade allows for one to take a view on convexity is similar to the analysis \\nof skew in the case of the put spread above. If we go long a butterﬂy spread, then we are \\nlong a 90% and a 110% strike call option, meaning that we are long the implied volatilities \\nat these two strikes. If the implied skew then becomes more convex, it means that these two \\nimplied volatilities have increased, making the butterﬂy spread more valuable. The holder of \\na butterﬂy spread is, therefore, long implied skew convexity. \\n3 This follows similar reasoning to the case of skew. Convexity, or curvature, of the skew is the second-order \\nderivative d2σImplied (K ) / dK 2. \\nf (x +h)+ f (x−h)−2 f (x ) 4 An approximation of the second derivative of a function f at the point x is given by h2 56 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n30% 20% 10% \\n0% \\n80% 85% \\n90% 95% 100% 105% 110% 115% \\nFigure 4.3 Curvature of implied volatility skew. All three implied volatility skews have the same \\n90–100% skew measurement, but different 90–100–110% convexity (or curvature). \\nThe implied volatilities of a single stock generally have more curvature, i.e. they are more \\nconvex than those of an index. The reason for this is that jumps (downward jumps to be precise) \\nhave a larger impact on single stocks than they do on an index, and the risk of a single stock \\ncrashing completely is greater than that of a whole index doing so. So, although a stock may \\nhave less negatively skewed implied volatilities than an index, the former’s implied volatilities \\nare more convex in strike than those of the index. \\n4.2.2 Term Structur e  of Volatilities \\nWhen we plot  the volatility skews over different maturities we obtain a volatility surface; \\nand for the moment we will focus on the term structure of volatilities (Figure 4.4). For a \\ngiven strike, ATM or otherwise, implied volatilities vary depending on the maturity of the \\noption. Firstly, let us look at the ATM volatilities and consider the term structure of ATM \\nimplied volatilities, which is the set of implied volatilities of ATM vanilla options on the \\nsame underlying plotted against different maturities. In most cases, the term structure is an \\nincreasing function of maturity, that is, longer maturities tend to have higher implied volatilities \\nthan shorter maturities. This is generally the case in calm periods where short-term volatilities \\nare relatively low. This curve could be decreasing if the market is volatile and short-term \\nvolatility is exceptionally high. This term structure can also reﬂect the market’s expectations \\nof an anticipated near term event in terms of the volatility that such an event would imply. The \\nterm structure also reﬂects the mean-reversion characteristic of volatility. \\nDepending on the  investor’s risk preference, increased demand for different maturities can \\nbe seen depending on the shape of the term structure. Those seeking high volatility will prefer \\nlonger maturities when the curve is pointing upwards, and shorter maturities when the curve \\nis a decreasing function. One can also take a view on the term structure’s shape, and a simple \\ntrade to provide this is the calendar spread, which is the difference of two call options of the \\nsame characteristics but different maturities.5 \\n5 See the section on calendar spreads in Chapter 6. 57 V olatility, Ske w and Term Structure \\n27% 24% 21% 18% \\n0 1 2 3 4 5 \\nFigure 4.4 Term structure of implied volatilities: implied volatilities plotted against maturities in \\nyears. Note the two distinct shapes. \\nSkews through Maturities \\nIf we look  at the implied volatility skew for various maturities we notice that the short-term \\nskew is much steeper than the long-term skew, and generally ﬂattens out as maturities increase. \\nThe level each skew is at is given by the ATM volatility term structure, whereby a long maturity \\ncould have a skew at a level higher than the short-term maturity, but the short-term skew will \\nbe more pronounced. Again this has to do with supply and demand, since, in the short term, \\npeople may be less keen to sell OTM puts (and thus the OTM put volatility). A jump in the \\nunderlying’s price in the immediate future would have a large impact on the price of the put; \\nfor the short term this is more severe as the market may not have time to recover. There is also \\nan increase in the OTM call implied volatility compared to the longer maturities, again for \\nsimilar reasons. \\n4.3 VOLATILITY MODELS \\nWe now discuss various models in the light of what we now know about term structure and \\nskew. As this book is not about how to build or implement models, we keep the discussion to \\nan intuitive level and do not go into too many mathematical details.6 Our goal is to explain \\nwhat to do with the many models that already exist. Ultimately, a model is still just a model, \\nand our goal is to ﬁnd – given a speciﬁc derivative or set of derivatives – the model that is \\nbest suited. Models can be useful only if properly understood, in both their limits and their \\nstrengths. Here we discuss these with respect to which forms of volatility each of the different \\nmodels captures. \\n4.3.1 Model Choice  and  Model Risk \\nEssentially, the choice  of which model to use depends on the different risks involved in the \\noption. As discussed earlier, the word option comes from the fact that such contracts offer \\n6 See Appendix A, sections A.1, A.2 and A.3 for more technical details. 58 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nsome form of optionality. Starting with the example of a call option, recall the present value \\nof a call option as in Figure 3.5 on page 38, and how this value is a convex function of the \\nunderlying price. This convexity, or second-order effect (non-linearity), in the underlying’s \\nprice is what gives the option value, and we must assume that the underlying’s price has some \\nrandomness in order to see this effect in whatever model we choose. In all our options, and in \\nall the models used, we will see that the price of the underlying on which the option is written \\nis modelled as a random variable. \\nWhen specifying  an y model, we are faced with what is known as model risk: the risk that \\na derivative is modelled incorrectly. This is divided into three forms, the ﬁrst of which is that \\nthe model being used has been incorrectly implemented. The focus of this book is not on \\nthis point, however, and we will assume that the models are readily available and correctly \\nimplemented, in order to answer the question of what to do with these models. Our focus is \\non the next two forms: (1) that the correct inputs are used in such models, and (2) that the \\ncorrect model is chosen for the correct derivative. Since many of the more exotic structures \\nto come are illiquid, it is imperative that we reduce these two forms of model risk as much \\nas possible. \\nTo give an  example regarding correct model inputs, one must take account of the liquidity \\nof the underlying and one’s ability to trade it in order to know the hedging costs accurately. \\nAn example of the right choice of model can be related to the volatility skew: what if the \\noption had skew dependence, that is, its price is sensitive not just to one implied volatility \\nbut to more than one. We call this a skew-sensitive product, and we need to use models that \\ncapture this effect. With regards to hedging, if one plans to trade European options in order \\nto hedge the Vega or Gamma risk of an exotic structure, then all such hedging instruments \\nmust be correctly priced in the calibration. The model as such will show risk against these \\ninstruments. In fact, we specify a calibration according to which instruments we want to see \\nrisk against. We discuss these issues from the point of volatility to understand how to capture \\nthe different characteristics of volatility when necessary. Other risks will become apparent as \\nwe move along (e.g. correlation risk in multi-asset options) and at each stage, when we meet \\nthem, we will explain the models that can capture these risks. \\n4.3.2 Black–Scholes or Flat  Volatility \\nThe Black–Scholes  model  has become a market standard in the sense that the prices of \\nvanilla options are quoted in terms of their implied volatilities rather than in dollar values. \\nAs we already saw, since we know the implied volatilities of call options from the market, \\nwe simply need to feed them into the Black–Scholes formula to get a price. There is a one-\\nto-one relationship between the price of a vanilla option and its implied volatility in the \\nBlack–Scholes formula, i.e. there exists a unique implied volatility that when put into the \\nBlack–Scholes formula returns this price. \\nWe will refer  to this as the case of ﬂat volatility, since the Black–Scholes model assumes \\nthat volatility, deﬁned as the annual standard deviation of the asset price, is constant across \\nstrikes. This means that the model does not know about the implied volatility skew, nor does \\nit know about the term structure of implied volatilities. However, the implied volatilities that \\none obtains for vanilla options in the market across strikes and maturities are those that should \\nbe fed into the Black–Scholes formula to obtain the correct values. As we saw, options with \\ndifferent maturities and/or different strikes will have different implied volatilities, but using the \\ncorrect implied volatility in Black–Scholes gives the correct price. The model’s other required 59 V olatility, Ske w and Term Structure \\ninputs are the current level of the underlying, the strike price, the maturity, the dividend yields,7 \\nthe repos and the interest rates that are all known to us. To obtain the price of a vanilla we only \\nneed the correct implied volatility based on the strike and the maturity of the vanilla. \\nCalls and puts  are liquidly traded instruments, and there is no real pricing to be done there. \\nSo the question arises: What other derivatives can we price correctly using ﬂat volatility? For \\nexample, the Asian (or average) options we saw in the previous chapter can be priced using \\nthe ﬂat volatility Black–Scholes model. As long as we use the correct implied volatility we \\ncan apply the model, either using a closed formula for Asian options or by simulating the asset \\nprice, to obtain the price of the Asian option. The reason why we can apply such a model in \\nthis case is that the Asian option does not have skew sensitivity8 or any hidden convexities \\nother than that to the underlying’s price. It is safe to assume that while the underlying’s price \\nis random, it has a constant volatility rendering the Black–Scholes model the appropriate one. \\nA second  e xample, which involves skew, is the call spread. The call spread is a combination \\nof a long call option (usually, but not necessarily, ATM) and a short call option of a strike \\ngreater than the ﬁrst call with all else remaining the same (i.e. the underlying and maturity). \\nIn this case we can apply the Black–Scholes model on the condition that we use the correct \\nimplied volatilities. The reason is that although the call spread is sensitive to skew, it is only \\nsensitive to two speciﬁc points on the skew: the volatilities at the correct strikes. This payoff \\ncan be broken down into two call options that can be correctly priced if we have the right \\nimplied volatilities for each. If the ﬁrst call has strike K1 and the second call has a strike K2, \\nwe cannot directly apply the Black–Scholes model and price the call spread as the difference \\nin price between the prices of the two calls. We need to use a different Black–Scholes model \\non each: for the ﬁrst we use the usual inputs speciﬁcally using the implied volatility of the \\nunderlying for that particular strike K1, plug into Black–Scholes and obtain the ﬁrst price. \\nSimilarly, for the second all inputs are the same except the strike and the implied volatility \\nof the K2 strike call option. The difference between these two prices is the price of the \\ncall spread. \\nEssentially this is  saying that even in the case of some skew dependence it may still be \\npossible to apply the Black–Scholes model as long as we are cautious about the various \\neffects, while keeping an eye on how the skew affects the price. In the call spread example, \\nhad we assumed a ﬂat volatility (i.e. the same volatility for both call options) we would have \\ndrastically mispriced the call spread. The reason we were able to do this is because the payoff \\nof the call spread is a linear combination of two vanillas. \\nIt is possible  to extend the case of a constant volatility across maturities to having a time-\\ndependent but deterministic volatility, thus allowing for a term structure of volatilities.9 It is \\nalso possible to allow for a term structure of interest rates which also makes this input more \\nrealistic compared to just a constant interest rate curve across maturities.10 The extensions that \\nallow for an implied volatility that is not constant across strikes are slightly more complex and \\n7 Note that in some cases, it is difﬁcult to estimate future dividend yields, particularly for long-dated options \\nowing to the uncertainty in future dividends. As such, one typically takes a model reserve to compensate for this \\nrisk. How much is a function of the maturity of the option and a view regarding the dividends of the speciﬁc asset in \\nconsideration. Alternatively, dividend swaps can be used to hedge this dividend risk. \\n8 The Asian option does have a slight skew sensitivity, but it is quite small and not something the market includes \\nin prices. \\n9 First appearance was in Merton (1973). \\n10 In reference to the various yield curve points that exist as we go along maturities: a term structure of rates. 60 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nwe now discuss models that capture some of the effects that Black–Scholes does not, pointing \\nout where such models are necessary. \\n4.3.3 Local Volatility \\nLocal\\n volatility models  offer a way of capturing the implied skew without introducing addi-\\ntional sources  of  randomness; the only source of which is the underlying asset’s price that \\nis modelled as a random variable. In the Black–Scholes model, the asset’s price is modelled \\nas a log-normal random variable, which means that the asset’s log-returns are normally dis-\\ntributed. However, assuming  that such a distribution allows for the simple formulas we see \\nin the Black–Scholes system, it is obviously not a realistic representation of the market. The \\nfact that we have a skew (i.e. that volatility is not constant across strikes) is the market telling \\nus that the asset’s log-returns have an implied distribution that is not Normal – a violation of \\nBlack–Scholes assumptions. \\nOne way around  this is to accept the additional source of randomness by letting the volatility \\nitself be random. Although we need this, and discuss it below under stochastic volatility, the \\nintroduction of the additional random factor (the volatility) increases the complexity of the \\nproblem. Local volatility is still a one-factor model and it also allows for risk-neutral dynamics, \\nwhich means that, like Black–Scholes, the model is preference free from the ﬁnancial point \\n(recall section 3.4.1 on risk-neutrality). This is not to say that other models cannot also be \\nrisk-neutral, but the local volatility model is the simplest one to account for skew and offers a \\nconsistent structure for pricing options. \\nHow, therefore,  does  local volatility work? We can agree that the market is telling us that \\nlog-returns are not normally distributed, in fact, the market is implying some distribution. If we \\nare given a set of prices of vanilla options for a ﬁxed maturity across strikes, or equivalently, \\ntheir implied volatilities, can we ﬁnd a distribution that corresponds to these prices? This is to \\nsay, can we ﬁnd a distribution for the asset price so that if we used this distribution to price \\nvanilla options on this asset, it would give the same prices as the vanillas on this asset seen \\nin the market? The answer was given to us by Dupire (1994) and also by Derman and Kani \\n(1994) that, yes, theoretically, there is a way to ﬁnd the distribution (local volatility model) \\nwhich corresponds exactly to all vanilla prices taken from the skew. In fact, local volatility \\nextends beyond skew and can also capture term structure. It can therefore theoretically supply \\nus with a model that gives the exact same prices for vanillas taken from a whole implied \\nvolatility surface. \\nIn a local  volatility model, the volatility of the underlying asset’s price is a deterministic \\nfunction of the asset’s price. It is not just a constant σ = σimplied (a constant) as in the case \\nof Black–Scholes, or a random variable itself as in stochastic volatility σ = σ (t ) (randomly \\nchanging through time), but in a local volatility model it is a function σ = σ (S(t ), t )o ft h e \\nasset price and possibly also time in a deterministic non-random manner. This is to say that \\nthe future evolution of the asset price at any point t in time is a function of the asset price S(t ) \\nat that time and also a function of time itself. \\nLocal Volatility Models and Calibr ation \\nFinding this function  σ (S(t), t ) is a process known as calibration . The inputs for these models \\nare not only the current level of the asset, the curve of riskless interest rates, and the size and \\ntiming of known dividends to come, but also the implied volatility skew (possibly a whole 61 V olatility, Ske w and Term Structure \\nsurface). Given the set of implied volatilities of vanilla options, calibration is the process where \\nwe search for these volatilities σ (S(t), t ) so that the model matches these prices. Assuming \\nthat the implementation is sound, once calibrated, these models can now be used to price more \\nexotic payouts, knowing that the model correctly prices the liquid vanillas. \\nThere are computational  difﬁculties in ﬁnding this function that will exactly ﬁt all market \\nprices, which is why Dupire’s formula, though theoretically correct, has some practical draw-\\nbacks. These  are  discussed in more detail in Appendix A, section A.2 on local volatility. In \\nparticular, ﬁtting all points may lead to unrealistic model dynamics – the local volatility model – \\nalthough ﬁtting the vanillas is actually not a good representation of how the asset really evolves. \\nIn practice, there may be more than one (often unlimited) local volatility model that ﬁts a set \\nof vanillas, so one must lay down a set of criteria to follow when choosing the model to use. \\nHere we distinguish two types of local volatility from the calibration point of view. Recall that \\nthe surface is two-dimensional, one in time and one in strike, and the focus on one or both \\nmust be determined in order to correctly capture the effect of the volatility surface on certain \\npayoffs. \\nDepending on the  payoff of the option, we may want to favour one calibration, or equivalently \\none set of functions σ (S(t), t ), over another. If the payoff involves only one date – for example \\na payoff on an asset S that depends only on the value S(T ) at maturity but not before – this \\nis equivalent to saying that there is no path dependency in the payoff. In this case, we only \\nneed to ﬁt the distribution to that maturity by taking the vanilla skew at that date only, and the \\nfocus is on getting the calibration done correctly for the strike regions in which the payoff is \\nsensitive. \\nAs an e xample, consider a call option that has the usual payoff while additionally paying \\nnothing if the underlying goes above a certain level: these are known as barrier options. As \\nwe will see in detail in barrier options, we must capture the skew if they are to be correctly \\npriced; if this barrier is only monitored at maturity, this has no path dependency and we \\nrequire only that the model ﬁts as best as possible the vanillas maturing on the same date as \\nthis option. \\nAssuming that the  call option is ATM (strike is at 100%), and the barrier is at 150% for \\nexample, we must make sure that the model correctly ﬁts the skew up to the point 150%. \\nThe focus here is on getting the calibration to correctly ﬁt the places where the derivative has \\nskew sensitivity. European options with these strikes can serve as hedging instruments and the \\nmodel must be calibrated to them to show risk against them. In the described example, the \\noption is sensitive to skew, however its sensitivity to the volatilities in the 70% strike region \\nfor example is minimal. Getting the calibration right in that region should not be done at the \\nexpense of less accuracy in the skew-sensitive region. We will refer to this case as exact date \\nﬁtting. \\nTake, on the  other hand, a derivative that has a huge amount of path dependency and again \\nlook at the above example of a knock-out call option that pays like a call option unless the asset \\ngoes above the barrier, in which case it pays nothing. Now allow the barrier to be monitored \\non a daily basis. At the close each day we see if the underlying went above this barrier level, \\nand, if so, the option is then immediately rendered worthless. \\nOur focus  on  the local volatility calibration in this case is different from the example above. \\nWe cannot in fact ﬁnd liquid vanillas for all dates, and therefore we have to work with a ﬁnite \\nset of maturities to which we can calibrate. In this instance we will only need vanillas of \\nmaturities up to the maturity of the knock-out call we are pricing, speciﬁcally because these \\ncan serve as hedging instruments for Vega or Gamma risk and must therefore be correctly /radicalBigg /summationtext\\n/radicaltp /radicalvertex /radicalvertex /summationdisplay \\n/summationtext62 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\npriced in the model. What we do need to know is that the local volatility model does imply \\na reasonable volatility for those dates in between the dates where we have vanilla data; that \\nis, we want to know that, through time, the calibration is smooth, so that we know that the \\nmodel is implying reasonable dynamics throughout. We also want to make sure that the strikes \\nare calibrated as best as possible, but must balance between these and a smooth calibration \\nthrough time. This case we refer to as smooth surface calibration . \\nWhen implied  v olatility data is not available, one must resort to interpolation or extrapolation \\nof the surface. Doing this in an arbitrage-free manner is discussed in Chapter 6, section 6.5. If \\nwe have implied volatilities for two strikes and need an implied volatility at a strike in between, \\nwe must interpolate in an arbitrage-free manner. In the case where, for example, we need data \\nthat is at extreme strikes (or maturities), we will have to extrapolate these from the data we \\nalready have. This may arise for long maturities for which we cannot ﬁnd liquid instruments, \\nand also for extreme OTM strikes. Again, the need to calibrate to such points is a function of \\nthe type of payoff and its relevant skew sensitivities. As we go through each new payoff we \\nwill specify if such problems arise through the discussions on the sensitivities of each. \\nCalibration errors  are  quantiﬁed by the root mean square error (RMSE), which measures \\nthe differences between the market data and those generated by the model. These are summed \\nto give \\nn \\n=1(market i − model i )2 \\nRMSE (market , model) = i\\nn \\nwhere n instruments  are involved in the calibration. The calibration aims to minimize the \\nRMSE. If we wanted to place more emphasis on speciﬁc points of the market data, the formula \\ncan be modiﬁed to \\nn \\nRMSE (market , model) = /radicalbt wi (market i − model i )2 \\ni =1 \\nnwhere i =1 wi = 1. In the case of equal weights this reduces to the above formula. \\n4.3.4 Stochastic Volatility  \\nIn stochastic  v olatility models, the asset price and its volatility are both assumed to be random \\nprocesses. Recall, in Black–Scholes, that volatility is assumed to be constant, and in local \\nvolatility models the volatility is a deterministic function of the asset’s level. Here in stochastic \\nvolatility models the volatility itself is assumed to be random. A quick observation of market \\ndata will show that the assumption that volatilities are constant is wrong, and that it would \\nmake sense to model volatility as a random variable as well as the underlying’s price. \\nIn allowing the  volatility to be random, stochastic volatility models give rise to implied \\nvolatility skews and term structures. By this we mean that if one values European options \\nusing a stochastic volatility model, then the volatilities implied by the model’s prices will \\nexhibit skew and term structure. Stochastic volatility models can explain in a self-consistent \\nmanner the actual features we see in the empirical data from the market. Once such a model is \\nspeciﬁed, the skews generated by the model are a function of its parameters, and ﬁnding the \\nparameters that ﬁt a certain skew (or a surface) is again the act of calibration. 63 V olatility, Ske w and Term Structure \\nThe question then arises: do we need such models? Do we need to always model volatility as \\na random variable, or can we still use constant or local volatility? The answer is that it depends \\non the derivative. As we saw in the example of the call and put spreads, options that can be \\nbroken down into vanillas can be priced using Black–Scholes as long as one uses the right \\nimplied volatility for each option. Now consider options such as the aforementioned barrier \\noption. These have skew dependency yet such payoffs cannot be broken down into vanillas. \\nIn such cases, we can use local volatility assuming it is correctly calibrated to the skew (or \\nsurface) in a manner consistent with the skew sensitivity of the option. Stochastic volatility, \\non the other hand, goes beyond just skew and term structure allowing for Vega convexity and \\nforward skew. \\nA derivative e xhibits V ega convexity when its sensitivity to volatility is non-linear: there is a \\nnon-zero second-order price sensitivity (or convexity) to a change in volatility. The assumption \\nthat volatility is random in stochastic volatility models captures the Vega convexity, in much \\nthe same way that the assumption that the underlying’s price is random in all models allows for \\nconvex payoffs in the underlying’s price. We have seen that vanilla options are convex in the \\nunderlying’s price, but are they also convex in volatility? The answer is that ATM vanillas are \\nnot, but OTM vanillas do have Vega convexity. However, these options are liquidly traded and \\ntheir prices are obtained by using their implied volatilities in Black–Scholes. These implied \\nvolatilities (from the implied surface) give the market’s consensus of the right price; therefore \\nthe cost of Vega convexity of OTM vanillas is included in the skew. \\nIn more comple x  payoffs, as we will see as we progress, almost all the payoffs will exhibit \\nsome form of Vega convexity, although in many cases this is captured in the skew and can be \\ncorrectly priced by getting the skew right (for example, with a local volatility model). Other \\npayoffs exhibit such convexities that are not captured in the skew and we must in these cases use \\nstochastic volatility. Since volatility is taken to be random, it must also have its own volatility, \\nand this is known as the volatility of volatility, or vol-of-vol. This parameter corresponds to \\nthe Vega convexity term, and when the holder of an option is long Vega convexity, we say she \\nis long vol-of-vol.11 Since local volatility does not consider volatility to be random it does not \\nknow about Vega convexity. The second-order sensitivity to volatility is known as V olga (see \\nsection 5.7.1 in Chapter 5 on Greeks). \\nThe second  feature  of stochastic volatility models is that they can generate forward skews. \\nTake a call option that matures in 3 years from today but starts 1 year from today. This is known \\nas a forward starting option and is discussed at length in Chapter 13 on cliquet structures. In \\nthis case, the correct volatility skew to use to price such an option is known as the forward \\nskew ; here in particular it is the 1- to 3-year forward skew. The T1 to T2 forward skew is \\ndifferent from the regular 0 to T1 and 0 to T2 skews, and if a derivative has exposure to forward \\nskew, one must use a model that knows about forward skews in order to get a correct price. \\nAlthough local  v olatility models can capture the market’s consensus on the prices of vanilla \\noptions by matching the volatility surface, the evolution of future volatility implied by these \\nmodels is not realistic. In the case of forward skews we are faced with the problem that the \\nforward skews generated by local volatility models ﬂatten out as we go forward in time, even \\nthough, in reality, forward skews have no reason to do so. The local volatility model, therefore, \\ndoes not provide the correct dynamics for products with sensitivities such as these. Stochastic \\n11 Section A.3 of Appendix A discusses stochastic volatility and gives more technical details regarding Vega \\nconvexity. 64 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nvolatility models, on the other hand – owing to the randomness of volatility – generate forward \\nskews that do not fade. In the chapter on cliquets, we deal with these issues in depth since many \\ncliquet structures are both convex in Vega and have exposure to forward skew. In Appendix A, \\nsection A.3.1, we discuss Heston’s stochastic volatility model (Heston, 1993) as an example \\nof a stochastic volatility model through which we elaborate on many of these issues. \\nThis issue  is  related to the question of smile dynamics. By smile dynamics we refer to the \\nphenomena of how the skew moves as the underlying moves: if the underlying moves in one \\ndirection, how should the skew move? The answer is that local volatility models can provide \\ninaccurate smile dynamics, while the dynamics of stochastic volatility models are, in fact, \\nmore consistent with the dynamics observed in the market. If an option is sensitive to smile \\ndynamics, then getting the smile dynamics wrong will have a large impact on both the price \\nand the computation of the subsequent hedge ratios. We will see this concept in the context of \\noption sensitivities as we move along. \\nOn the calibration  side, stochastic volatility models have difﬁculty ﬁtting both ends of the \\nsurface, that is, ﬁtting the skew for both short and long maturities at the same time. One remedy \\nfor this is to add jumps to a stochastic volatility model. Jumps are able to explain the short-term \\nskew quite well, and we recall that the reason for the existence of the steep short-term skew \\nhas to do with jumps. Adding jumps to such a model does not generally affect the long-term \\nskews which remain relatively ﬂatter; the long-term implied skew is not driven by jumps in \\nthe underlying. In Appendix A, section A.4, we discuss combining models and see jumps in \\nmore detail. 5 \\nOption Sensitivities: Greeks \\nSometimes you have to risk what you want in order to get what you want. \\nThe buying or selling of a derivative creates a position with various sources of risk, some \\nof which may be unwanted risk. Hedging in this case is the act of reducing these risks by \\nengaging in ﬁnancial transactions that counterbalance these risks. If the seller of an option \\ndecides not to hedge, then this is referred to as a naked position and can be very risky. When a \\nbank sells a derivative to a client, it should understand all the risks associated with the product \\nand hedge its position accordingly. Once a sale is done, the product is added to an existing \\nbook of options, and it is the book that must be risk managed. In order to see where the risks \\nlie, the trader hedging a derivative will need to know the sensitivity of the derivative’s price to \\nthe various parameters that impact its value. The sensitivities of an option’s price, also known \\nas hedge ratios, are commonly referred to as the Greeks since many of them are labelled and \\nreferred to by Greek letters. Many articles and books in the literature discuss hedging, and \\nTaleb (1997) is a very practical example. \\nIn this chapter  we will discuss the various Greeks, their meanings and their implications on \\nthe pricing and hedging of derivatives. Firstly, we cover the Greeks of derivatives involving \\nonly one underlying asset, then look at the cases of derivatives with multiple underlying assets. \\nWe end with a section presenting some useful formulas that give the approximations based on \\nthe Greeks as these can serve as quick mental checks. \\nTo obtain  the  price of an exotic derivative, one is more often than not forced to use some \\nmodel. As we discussed in Chapter 4, it is imperative that one uses the correct model to \\nprice, but since the sensitivities of the price are also computed using a model, we discuss \\nthe implications of various models on the option price’s sensitivity. Most of the analysis is \\ndone under the Black–Scholes model seen in Chapter 3, but details are given for the cases \\nwhere assumptions such as those of Black–Scholes can lead to false hedge ratios. One must \\nunderstand the implications of any model, Black–Scholes or otherwise, and the impact of the \\nmodel’s assumptions on the hedge ratios it generates; if the model is wrong, then the hedge \\nratios computed using this model will typically also be wrong. \\nIn some  cases,  although uncommon, an exotic product may have all its cashﬂows aligned \\nwith those of derivatives that can be traded liquidly in the market and can thus be hedged by \\ntaking the opposite position in such derivatives at the onset of the contract. This is known as a \\nstatic hedge because once this hedge is put into place, as an initial hedge, there is no need for \\nfurther hedging irrespective of how the market moves. If liquidly traded instruments allow for \\nsuch a hedge, then the hedge is model independent: as discussed in Chapter 3, the cost of the \\nderivative is the cost of its hedge, and in this case we know the cost of setting up such a hedge \\nwithout resorting to any models. A static hedge can of course involve the underlying itself in \\naddition to options. From a pricing perspective, the cost of setting up this hedge is the price of \\nthe derivative, and we do not need a model, just market prices. The existence of a static hedge \\ncan thus provide us with both a price and a hedge. 66 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nIn the general case of exotic structures, such a hedge is not possible and what is known \\nas a dynamic hedge must be put in use. To dynamically hedge means that from the day the \\ntrade is active1 an initial hedge put into place will need to be readjusted at future dates. The \\nreason for this is that once such a hedge is in place, it is sensitive to movements in the market \\nand must be modiﬁed to still be a hedge. How often hedges should be adjusted is dependent \\non the nature of the sensitivity and its impact on the price. The day 1 hedge may consist of \\na static part that needs no further adjustment, and a dynamic part that will need adjustment \\nthrough the life of the product. We see the risks introduced by single options and how these \\nthen contribute on a book level. Throughout this work we go through each new structure in \\ndetail, analysing the risks, on a product by product basis. Where notable we discuss, in the \\ntext, book level hedging. For example, the sale of many of the common multi-asset options \\nresults in large short correlation positions, on a book level. \\nRebalancing dynamic  hedges  is a trading decision that depends on many factors, including \\nmarket movements that result in the sizes of certain risks increasing, decreasing, or even \\nchanging sign. The frequency of the readjusting hedges must also take into account the \\ntransaction costs involved in buying and selling in the market. On an individual option basis \\none takes into account the notional size of the option, because this determines the size of \\nthe risks. On a book level, one thinks about aggregated risks because individual risks from \\ndifferent options may offset each other, and hedging can be done by buying or selling further \\noptions to explicitly eliminate existing risks. \\n5.1 DELTA \\nWe begin the discussion of the Greeks with Delta, the most fundamental of all Greeks. A \\nderivative is named as such because it derives its value from an underlying asset. Delta is the \\nsensitivity of an option to the price of this underlying asset on which the derivative is written. \\nTo understand the concept of sensitivity we must ﬁrst mention the Taylor series. There is no \\nneed to be alarmed mathematically, as this simply gives us the various orders of sensitivities. \\nWe were all taught how to compute the derivative of a function at some point, but what does this \\nderivative mean? If we compute the derivative of a function f (x ) at a point, what information \\ndoes this give us? If we consider the price of an option as a function of the underlying’s price \\nS, written Price( S), and ask how much is the rate of change of this price if the underlying \\nmoves by an amount x (that is, if the underlying’s price moves from S to S +x , by how much \\ndoes the price of the derivative change), the answer is given by the Taylor series \\ndP r i c e ( S)Price( S +x)  = Price( S) + x + 1 d2 Price( S) x2 +··· dS 2 dS2 \\nSo the change in price is given by \\ndP r i c e ( S)Price( S +x)  −Price( S) = x + 1 d2 Price( S) x2 +··· (5.1)dS 2 dS2 \\nThe ﬁrst derivative w.r.t. S on the right-hand side of this equality is the ﬁrst-order sensitivity \\nof the price to a movement in S, and is known as the Delta. If x is small, meaning there is \\nonly a small movement in S, then the price of the derivative will move by Delta times x (the \\n1 Active meaning it has sensitivities, often the start date of the option, but in some cases earlier if it is forward \\nstarting. Such cases are discussed under forward starting options in Chapter 13 on cliquet structures. 67 Option Sensitivities:  Greeks \\n0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 \\n0 \\n−0.1 \\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 \\n−0.2 −0.3 \\nFigure 5.1 The present value of a call option across spot prices with the ATM Delta tangent. \\nrate of change in the price w.r.t. to S times the amount by which S moved). In Figure 5.1 the \\ncurved line is the price of a call option plotted against the underlying’s price. The ATM Delta \\nis 0.5635 and the dotted straight line has a slope of 0.5635, tangent to the curve of the price at \\nthe ATM point. A Delta of 0.5635 means that if the underlying moves by an amount, say 1%, \\nthen the value of the derivative will move by 0.5635 ×1%. \\nTo hedge  ag ainst movements in the underlying, a seller of a call option must buy Delta \\nunits of the underlying. Assume the call option is written on an underlying S whose price at \\nthe time of sale is $24.5, Delta is 0.5635 and that the notional of the call option is $1million, \\nthen the seller needs to buy $1, 000, 000 ×0.5635 = $563, 500 in the underlying stock.2 This \\nequates to $563, 500/$24.5 = 23, 000 shares. The portfolio consisting of the option (short) \\nand Delta of stock (long), is Delta neutral. As Delta changes with movements in the underlying, \\nthe amount of the underlying that needs to be held to remain Delta neutral will need to be \\nadjusted, thus this is a dynamic hedge. As the underlying moves, the seller will have to readjust \\nthis Delta hedge by buying more units of the underlying, or selling some units, depending on \\nwhether the underlying goes up or down. The Delta of a call option on a stock is non-negative \\nand it can take any value in the range [0, 1]. As the option goes deep into the money, Delta \\napproaches its maximum value of 1, and if the option is deep out-of-the-money, Delta will be \\nclose to zero. In the deep ITM case, a Delta of 1 reﬂects the high probability that the option \\nwill be exercised, and in the deep OTM case, the option will most likely not be exercised. \\nIn a book  consisting of many options, some of the Deltas of the various options may cancel \\neach other. The linearity of addition of the Deltas within a portfolio follows from the fact \\nthat each Delta is essentially a mathematical derivative and the derivative is linear. Consider \\na portfolio P consisting of n options: O1, O2, ..., On all written on the same underlying asset \\nwhose price we denote as S, then the sensitivity of the price of the portfolio P t oam o v e m e n t \\nin the price of S is given by the sum of the individual Deltas of the n options: \\n/Delta1P = /Delta1O1 +/Delta1O2 +···+ /Delta1On \\n2 Recall the discussion in Chapter 3 regarding the relationship between a call option with ﬁxed notional, paying \\nthe positive returns of the underlying, and a call option to buy a speciﬁc number of shares. 68 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nOther than trading the underlying itself to Delta hedge, it is also possible to use forwards \\nor futures. Recall that in the case of liquidly traded futures – for example, futures on major \\nequity indices – the value of the futures/forward contract at time t (assuming, for simplicity, \\nno dividends) with maturity T is given by F(t) = S(t)er(T−t). So if the price of the underlying \\nchanges by δ S, the futures price changes by δSer(T−t), that is, the Delta of the futures contract \\ni s g i v e nb yer(T−t). Matching a required Delta hedge in the underlying asset, /Delta1S, with a \\nposition in a futures contract on this underlying we simply require a position of e−r(T−t)/Delta1S in \\nthe futures contract. \\nOne can further  exploit correlations between assets to Delta hedge. Speciﬁcally, if an option \\nis written on an asset with price S1, then it is possible to use a second asset S2 to Delta hedge, \\ni.e. one can trade  in the asset S2 to offset the ﬁrst-order sensitivity of the option to movements \\nin S1. Denoting the price of the option by P, where we know that /Delta1 = ∂ P/∂ S1 is the required \\namount of S1 to buy or sell for Delta hedging, we want to ﬁnd /Delta12, which is the amount of S2 \\nto buy or sell for Delta hedging. To do this we need to measure the expected movement in S2 \\nwhen S1 moves, simply because of the chain rule: \\n∂ P ∂  P ∂ S2 ∂ S2 /Delta1 = = = /Delta12 (5.2)∂ S1 ∂ S2 ∂ S1 ∂ S1 \\nIf we use Black–Scholes assumptions, speciﬁcally the log-normality of the asset prices, and de-\\nnote ρ1,2 to be the correlation between S1 and S2 – i.e speciﬁcally the instantaneous correlation \\nbetween the returns – then we can measure the change in S2 for a change in S1 by \\n∂ S2 σ2 S2 = ρ1,2 (5.3)∂ S1 σ1 S1 \\nand accordingly we know the value of /Delta12 in equation (5.2). The ability to do this can be \\nextremely useful when Delta hedging in practice, and we will see examples of this use as we \\nproceed. \\nUnder Black–Scholes  assumptions,  the Deltas for call and put options are given by \\n/Delta1Call = e−qT N (d1) /Delta1Put = e−qT [N (d1) − 1] \\nwhere d1 is deﬁned as usual in Black–Scholes following Chapter 3, and q is the dividend yield. \\nIn Figure 5.2, the Deltas of three different options are plotted against the price (in percentages) \\nof the underlying: the ATM call option, the 80% strike ITM and 120% OTM calls. Notice that, \\nalthough we are on the extreme cases of very low and very high levels of the underlying, Delta \\napproaches the limits of its range. This is because a very high level of the underlying would \\nimply that the call option will most probably be exercised, and if it is exercised, recall from \\nthe deﬁnition of the call option that the holder of the call has the right to buy the underlying \\nasset at the agreed strike price. On the other hand, if the underlying’s level is low and the \\noption deep OTM, then the Delta will be close to zero because this option will have very low \\nintrinsic value. \\nThe Delta  of  a European option is sensitive to the time to expiry, the volatility of the \\nunderlying asset, and the difference between the strike and spot prices. In Figure 5.3 we can \\nsee the effects of time and volatility on the Delta of the call option. \\nFigures 5.4 and  5.5 illustrate how Delta changes with movements in the underlying. They \\nalso illustrate the effects of moneyness and time to expiry. The expiry of the option corresponds \\nto where the series for the underlying’s price ends, one year. Figure 5.4 has three different \\nscenarios for the path of the underlying, expressed in terms of percentages, and Figure 5.5 69 Option Sensitivities:  Greeks \\n1.2 \\n1 \\n0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 \\n0 \\n25% 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 0% \\nITM, K = 80% OTM, K = 120% ATM, K = 100% \\nFigure 5.2 The Delta sensitivities of call options with different strikes. \\ngives the values of the Deltas of an ATM option assuming each of the scenarios in Figure 5.4. \\nWe assume that we are long the ATM call option and will thus go short Delta of the underlying \\nasset to remain Delta neutral. The Delta in Figure 5.3 is positive owing to the fact that we are \\nlong the option, but to become Delta neutral we will need to take the opposite position and \\nshort Delta of stock. \\nThe volatility of  the underlying is assumed constant throughout when computing these \\nDeltas, which may not be a realistic assumption but illustrates the point. In fact, ideally we \\nwould use the realized volatility of the underlying to compute Delta, but the problem is that \\nwe cannot know in advance what the realized volatility of the underlying’s price will be. \\nThe hedging errors resulting from the wrong volatility are discussed in Chapter 6, on option \\nstrategies. \\nIn Figures  5.4  and 5.5, both the series for the underlying and the Deltas are computed using \\ndaily observations. There are a few interesting points to be made regarding these ﬁgures: ﬁrstly, \\nnote that all three Deltas start at the same point, but as time moves on and the underlying \\nmoves, each of the Deltas goes up or down depending on whether the underlying went up or \\ndown. In series 1, notice that the underlying actually reached a level around half-way through \\nthe year that was actually lower than the point at which it ended; however, the Deltas at these \\n1.2 \\n1 \\n0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 \\n0 \\n0% 25% 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% \\nT = 1, Vol = 15% T = 1, Vol = 30% T = 4, Vol = 15% \\nFigure 5.3 The effects of time and volatility on the Delta of a call option. 70 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n105% 100% \\n95% 90% 115% 110% \\n0.00 0.20 0.40 0.60 0.80 1.00 \\nSeries 1 Series 2 Series 3 \\nFigure 5.4 Three scenarios for the path of the underlying asset. \\ntwo points are different. This is due to the effect of time to expiry since, when it reached its \\nlow, there was still half a year to go, but as it dipped lower than the strike in the last month, \\nDelta dropped substantially and ended up at zero, close to expiry. \\nIn series  2  the underlying, apart from the ﬁrst period, generally kept increasing further \\nand further into the money, and Delta also gradually increased to reach the value of 1 before \\nmaturity. It remained close to 1 until maturity even though the underlying moved slightly \\nbecause the option was deep in-the-money and approaching maturity, meaning it was likely to \\nbe exercised. In series 3, Delta moved around but shot up in the last few days as the underlying \\nwas still close to the strike, but stayed above it approaching maturity. \\nNote that in  all the scenarios, from the start to expiry, as Delta increases we need to sell \\nmore stock to remain Delta hedged since we are long the option and thus short Delta of the \\n100% \\n80% 60% 40% 20% \\n0% \\n0.00 0.20 0.40 0.60 0.80 1.00 \\nDelta 1 Delta 2 Delta 3 \\nFigure 5.5 The Deltas of an ATM option based on the above three paths of the underlying. 71 Option Sensitivities:  Greeks \\nunderlying. Vice versa, as the underlying decreases and Delta decreases, we need to buy back \\nstock in order to remain Delta neutral. \\nOwing to the  uncertainty involved in Delta hedging, and the costs involved in buying and \\nselling the underlying asset, one would want to keep Delta hedging to a minimum; traditionally \\nDelta hedges are rebalanced on a daily basis. One should adjust the effect of time on Delta for \\nholidays and weekends, because even if the underlying does not move, time will have elapsed \\nand this has an impact on Delta, especially in the cases where there is little time left to expiry \\nand the underlying is still close to the strike. The effect of time elapsing on the price of the \\noption is the Greek known as Theta, discussed below, and the effect of time on Delta is known \\nas Charm. \\nLiquidity is also  a concern, and must be taken into account. The bottom line is that to be \\nhedged one will need to buy or sell a certain amount of stock on day 1 and adjust this hedge \\nas time goes by. If the stock is illiquid and hard to trade, one must make adjustments. In some \\ncases it is difﬁcult to short stocks, which may be necessary to Delta hedge, and borrow costs \\n(repos) will need to be factored into the price. \\nOther parameters  impacting  Delta hedging are dividends and interest rates. Although the \\nDeltas of an exotic derivative can be quite different to those of vanillas, a desk selling exotic \\nproducts will typically be structurally long the underlying assets from having to buy Delta \\nin these assets. When long Delta in an underlying, the trader will be long the dividends paid \\nby the underlying, and dividends are a necessary input to obtain a correct price and hedge, \\nbut they are uncertain in the sense that a company’s dividends may change owing to various \\nfactors. Expectations regarding dividends can be factored into the price in the form of a term \\nstructure of dividend yields, or priced at current levels and hedged using a dividend swap. On \\na book level, large exposures to dividend ﬂuctuations will need to be hedged. \\nRegarding interest  rates,  we note that when a trader needs to buy Delta of stock, the trader \\nwill have to borrow money in order to buy whatever units of stock are needed. If rates go up, \\nthen it costs more to borrow money thus making the hedging process more expensive. This is \\ndiscussed in the section below under the interest rate sensitivity of options, referred to by the \\nGreek letter Rho. \\nExercise Imagine you are\\n  in charge of Delta hedging a portfolio of options. And let’s assume that you \\nare short skew and volatility goes down. Would you end up buying or selling underlying \\nshares? Discussion As discussed  in\\n  Chapter 4, the skew increases the price of OTM puts and ITM calls; and \\ndecreases the price of OTM calls and ITM puts. Being short the skew can mean being \\nshort OTM puts, short ITM calls, long OTM calls or long ITM puts. Let’s consider the case \\nwhere you are long OTM call options. If volatility goes down, the Delta of OTM calls goes \\ndown, as shown in Figure 5.3. Since you are long the options, the portfolio overall Delta \\nis then negative. Therefore, you have to buy shares to maintain zero sensitivity to the spot \\nprice of underlying shares. /Gamma1 = \\n/Gamma1= 72 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n5.2 GAMMA \\nGamma represents the second-order sensitivity of the option to a movement in the underlying \\nasset’s price. In the Taylor series of equation (5.1) this is given by the second term on the \\nright-hand side involving the second derivative of the price w.r.t. the asset price \\n∂2 Price( S) \\n∂ S2 \\nAs is clear from Figure 5.1 above, the price of a call option as a function of the underlying \\nprice is non-linear. Gamma allows for a second-order correction to Delta to account for this \\nconvexity. For a non-small move x as in equation (5.1), i.e. the corresponding movement in \\nthe option price, the second-order effect is not negligible. This convexity in the underlying \\nprice is what gives the call option value, and in order to see the second-order effect in pricing \\nwe will always use models that assume some form of randomness in the asset’s price. \\nThe Black–Scholes  Gamma  for both calls and puts is given by \\nN /prime(d1)e−qT \\n/Gamma1 = √ \\nSσ T \\nThe dollar  or  cash Gamma is given by Gamma times S2: \\n∂2 Price( S) · S2 $ \\n∂ S2 \\nand, as the name implies, once we multiply by the asset price squared, the unit of the cash \\nGamma is the dollar (or whatever currency we are working with) value of Gamma. \\nIn Figure  5.6  notice the effect of volatility on Gamma: a higher volatility lowers the Gamma \\nof the call option when the underlying is near the strike, but raises it when the underlying \\nmoves away from the strike. We can think of this effect in terms of the time value of European \\noptions. For low levels of volatility, the Gamma is low for deep ITM and OTM options because, \\nfor low levels of volatility, these options have little time value and can only gain time value if \\nthe underlying moves closer to the strike. On the other hand, a high volatility means that both \\n2 \\n1.5 \\n1 \\n0.5 \\n0 \\n0% 50% 100% 150% 200% 250% \\nK = 100%, Vol = 20%, T = 1 K = 120%, Vol = 20%, T = 1 \\nK = 100%, Vol = 20%, T = 4 K = 100%, Vol = 30%, T = 1 \\nFigure 5.6 The effects of strike price, time and volatility on the Gamma of a call option.

These series correspond to the series of the underlying in Figure \\n5.4. \\nITM and OTM options have time value and so the Gamma sensitivity near the strike should \\nnot be too different from the Gamma away from the strike. \\nGamma, being  the  second derivative, is the ﬁrst-order sensitivity of Delta to a movement in \\nthe underlying. Gamma tells us how much Delta will move if the underlying moves. Recall that \\nthe corresponding graphs of Figures 5.4 and 5.5 show how Delta changes as the underlying \\nmoves. The magnitude of these changes is given by Gamma. In Figure 5.7 we see the Gamma \\nof an ATM call option making the same assumptions as the discussion of Figures 5.4 and 5.5. \\nThe Gammas in series 1 and 3 grow quite large close to maturity, because the underlying in \\nboth these series was close to the strike and a small movement could have sent the option in \\nor out of the money. This, in turn, means that Delta can change substantially if the underlying \\nmoved even slightly and thus the Delta’s sensitivity to the underlying’s price, given by Gamma, \\nis quite large. \\nAlthough all three  series followed different paths, their Gammas in Figure 5.7 during the \\nﬁrst half of the life of the option are quite similar. This shows the impact of time to expiry \\non Gamma when the underlying is trading near the strike. For example, at the points 0.33 \\nand 0.89 of the year the asset prices in series 3 were the same, but since the latter case was \\nmuch closer to maturity, the corresponding Gamma was much larger. In series 2 the option \\nbecame deep in-the-money, and as maturity approached a small change in the underlying was \\nnot going to affect the fact that it was probably going to stay in-the-money and be exercised. \\nThus the Gamma fades away as we approach maturity because Delta is close to 1 and small \\nmovements do not have a large effect on our need to have one unit of the underlying in order \\nto pay out once the call is exercised. \\nThe Gamma  of  a European option is high when the underlying trades near the strike. \\nNotice the ATM call option’s Gamma in Figure 5.6 and also the scenarios of Figure 5.7. Near \\nthese points, there will be the need for more frequent Delta hedging and thus inﬂict more \\nhedging costs upon the trader. In the example of an OTM put that pays when the market \\ndeclines, its Gamma will be lower on day 1 than it will if the market declines. The Gamma \\nof the put increases as the market declines and the option becomes closer to the money, with \\nGamma being highest when the underlying is at the strike. In addition, the scenario of a \\nmarket decline is generally accompanied by an increase in volatility (recall the discussion in 74 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nChapter 4 on volatility and skew), and more movements in the underlying means more need \\nfor readjustments in Delta. \\nThe concept  of  a Delta-hedged portfolio of options means that the portfolio has been hedged \\nby trading in the underlying assets against small movements in these assets. Gamma represents \\nthe sensitivity of Delta to a movement in the underlying asset’s price, and Gamma hedging \\ncan lower the sensitivity of Delta on a movement in price. As a second-order effect, Gamma \\nbecomes increasingly signiﬁcant when a large move in the underlying’s price occurs and the \\nDelta moves with according signiﬁcance. To hedge this Gamma one will need to trade other \\nEuropean options in a manner that the Gammas cancel out and yield a lower overall Gamma. \\nWe note that the need for trading options to Gamma hedge instead of again using the underlying \\nasset, a forward or a futures contract, is that these three tradeable instruments are all linear in \\nthe underlying price, and thus add no convexity. Gamma represents the convexity (non-linear) \\nof the option price, and to remove (some of) this convexity one must use another convex \\ninstrument, i.e. another option. By lowering Gamma (i.e. lowering the overall convexity of the \\nposition) we lower the need for the large and frequent rebalancing of Delta. \\nLike Delta,  the  Gamma of a portfolio is the sum of the individual Gammas of the options in \\nthe portfolio. Take a portfolio that has a Gamma /Gamma1P and an option O with Gamma /Gamma1O, then, \\ndepending on the sign of the portfolio’s Gamma, we either buy (when /Gamma1P is negative) or sell \\n(when /Gamma1P is positive) a number of units n of the option, so that the absolute value of the new \\nportfolio P/prime= P ± n · O, given by /Gamma1P/prime= /Gamma1P ± n/Gamma1O is as close to zero as desired. \\nAs we mo ve into exotic structures, we ﬁnd that these may have quite different Gamma \\nproﬁles to the European options seen here. For example, in the cliquet structures seen in \\nChapter 13, Gamma can change sign. In the case of barriers and digitals (Chapters 10 and 11), \\nthe Greeks near the barriers can become extremely large and unstable, and we will discuss \\nfurther methods of handling such Greeks. \\n5.3 VEGA \\nVega isn’t actually a Greek letter, but it now represents an important Greek. Vega is the \\nsensitivity of the option price to a movement in the volatility of the underlying asset. Since \\nEuropean options are priced using their implied volatilities, the Vega is the sensitivity to a \\nmovement in the implied volatility of the underlying asset. We note that this contradicts the \\nBlack–Scholes theory in which volatility is assumed to be constant through time; however, it \\nis important to see how an option’s price, or the value of a book of options, changes as the \\nresult of a change in this parameter. Differentiating the price w.r.t this volatility gives us Vega, \\nthe ﬁrst-order sensitivity. \\nUnder Black–Scholes  the  Vega of both calls and puts is given by \\n√ −qT N /prime(d1) V = Se T  (5.4) \\nwhere \\nN /prime(x) =√ 1e−x2 /2 \\n2π \\nA drawing of  this formula is shown in Figure 5.8. In formula (5.4) for Vega, the moneyness term \\n(ln S/K) appears in (and only in) the term N /prime(d1) =√1e−d12 /2, so with respect to moneyness, 2π \\nVega is greatest when moneyness is zero (ATM, that is) and decays exponentially on both sides \\nthus giving the bell-shaped curve we see in Figure 5.9. This makes sense intuitively because if 75 Option Sensitivities:  Greeks \\n0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 \\n0 \\n0% 50% \\n100% 150% 200% 250% 300% \\nT = 1, Vol = 30% T = 2, Vol = 30% T = 1, Vol = 20% \\nFigure 5.8 Effects of different volatilities and maturities on a European’s Vega. \\nwe are at the money then a change in the volatility of the underlying asset can send the option \\neither in-the-money or out-of-the-money, thus the large effect on the price. Should we be quite \\nin-the-money (or relatively out-of-the-money), then although a change in volatility will have an \\nimpact on the price, its impact is not as much as a change in volatility is if we are at the money. \\nFor European  options  the Vega position is simple. Both calls and puts have positive Vega, \\nwhich means that if we sell a European option, then we are short the volatility of the underlying \\nasset. If we buy a European option, then we are long this volatility. For more exotic structures, \\nthe Vega proﬁle, like the Gamma proﬁle, can change sign, and whether we are short or long \\nvolatility depends on the underlying’s price. An example of this is the call spread discussed in \\nChapter 6 on options strategies. \\nThe overall sensiti vity of a portfolio to volatility can be hedged by adding more positions in \\noptions (speciﬁcally liquid ones), so that the added (or subtracted) Vegas lower the absolute \\nvalue of the portfolio’s Vega. A book of exotics, or even a single exotic product, can have \\ndifferent sensitivities to the various implied volatilities along the term structure, and these \\n0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 \\n0 \\n0% 50% 100% 150% 200% 250% 300% \\nVega of an ATM Call Vega of an OTM Call \\nFigure 5.9 The Vegas of an ATM call and a 120% strike OTM call. 76 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n0.3 \\n0.25 \\n0.2 \\n0.15 \\n0.1 \\n0.05 \\n0 \\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% \\n5% ITM Call 20% OTM Call ATM Call \\nFigure 5.10 The prices of three different 1-year call options plotted against volatility. \\nare referred to as Vega buckets , each corresponding to the volatility sensitivity of a particular \\nmaturity on the term structure of implied volatilities. Depending on the product, movement \\nin the underlying assets can trigger barriers or replacement events, for example, which then \\ngreatly vary the Vega to the relevant implied volatilities requiring rebalances in the Vega \\nhedges. We discuss these effects on a product by product basis, but note again that the cost of \\nan option should reﬂect the cost of hedging it, and it is imperative that one understands the \\nrisks entailed in hedging an option. As discussed in the context of models in Chapter 4, all \\nsuch hedging instruments must be correctly priced in the calibration, so that the model as such \\nwill show risk against these instruments – speciﬁcally, those instruments with maturities that \\ncorrespond to the Vega buckets in which the option has Vega risk. \\nIn Figure  5.10  the prices of three call options are plotted against volatility. Rates are set at \\n2% and dividends are assumed to be zero. The ATM option is almost linear in volatility. The \\nprices of the ITM and OTM options are convex in volatility up to a certain level then become \\nlinear for large volatilities. This non-linearity is called Vega convexity and is discussed below \\nas Vega–Gamma, also known as V olga. \\nThe ATM and  ITM options are not worth zero when volatility is zero. In the case of the \\nATM, even if volatility were zero, the forward is not null and the call option still has a value \\nof approximately r × T = 2% × 1 = 2%. This also applies to the ITM call, but – and only in \\nthis case – the option additionally already has 5% in intrinsic value. \\n5.4 THETA \\nThe Theta of an option is the rate at which the option price varies over time (Figure 5.11). \\nThe previous Greeks measured the change to the option price if one of the discussed factors \\nchanged, but time is always moving forward and so even if all else remained the same, the \\noption’s value will change as time goes by. The rate at which it changes is usually expressed \\nin days, meaning how much does the option price change after one day, all else being equal? 77 Option Sensitivities:  Greeks \\nCall option Theta Put option Theta \\nFigure 5.11 Theta of a call and put with respect to the spot price. \\nAn option that loses 0.05% per day is said to have a Theta of −0.05%. If we buy a call option \\n(or a put) we will have a negative Theta, and vice versa. \\nAssume, for e xample, that we buy an OTM call option and the underlying does not move at \\nall. Then as time passes, the value of this call option decreases because the option simply has \\nless time to expiry. If the Theta of an option is negative, then the passing of time will lower \\nthe value of the option, and vice versa. \\nUnder Black–Scholes,  the  Theta of a call option is given by \\n−qT N /prime(d1) −qT N (d1) Sσ e/Theta1call =− √ −rKe−rTN (d2) +qSe\\n2 T \\nand for put options, Theta is \\n−qT N /prime(d1) −qT N (−d 1) Sσ e/Theta1put =− √ +rKe−rT N (−d 2) −qSe\\n2 T \\nFollowing the same  series as in Figure 5.4, in Figure 5.12 we plot the Theta of the ATM \\ncall option based on the three different series. The ﬁrst thing to note is that the Theta of the \\ncall option is always non-positive. As we can see, the options that are close to the money near \\nmaturity will exhibit the most time decay. \\n5.5 RHO \\nRho is the Greek letter used to represent the sensitivity of an option’s price to a movement in \\ninterest rates. In the Black–Scholes model, the Rho of a call option is given by \\n−rT N (d2) Rho call =KT e\\nand the Rho  of a put option is the negative of this. The prices of call and put options are almost \\nperfectly linear in interest rates; the reason for this is that a change in rates only has a ﬁrst-order \\neffect on the price of the option. This effect comes from the impact of an increase in rates on \\nthe cost of Delta hedging and also from discounting the option price. For a small change in \\nrates this combines for a linear effect on the price of the derivative. This is emphasized using \\na hedging argument to answer the questions posed in the exercise. 78 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n0.0 0.4 0.8 1.0 \\nSeries 1 Series 2 Series 3 0.2 0.6 \\nFigure 5.12 Scenarios for Theta. These series correspond to the series of the underlying in Figure 5.4. \\nExercise What impact  will\\n  an increase in interest rates have on the price of a call option? How about \\na put option? There is also the question of the effect on dividends. \\nDiscussion Assume that \\n we sell a call option, then we need to buy /Delta1 of stock. To buy /Delta1 we will need \\nto borrow money, so if the rates go up, it costs us more to borrow money (sell bonds) in \\norder to Delta hedge. Since the option price reﬂects the cost of hedging, the price of the \\ncall must go up if hedging costs go up. \\nFor a put  option it is the other way around. If we sell a put then we need to sell /Delta1 of \\nstock. We sell /Delta1 of stock and lend this money (buy bonds), so if rates go up we will make \\nmore money from our hedging strategy and thus the price of the put should be lower if \\nrates go up. \\nWe can add  the effect of discounting. If rates go up, the discount factor goes down thus \\nlowering the price of options. This is the case for both calls and puts, but in both this effect \\nis generally smaller than the effect of rates on our Delta hedge. In the case of the call, the \\neffect of discounting counters slightly the effect of the rise in the cost of borrowing money. \\nIn the case of the put, higher rates mean lower prices and the discount factor lowers them \\nfurther. \\nSimilar arguments can  be made in regards to the price sensitivity to the dividend yield \\nof the underlying asset. If we sell a call option, we need to buy Delta of the asset. If we \\nhold the asset we are long the dividends paid by this asset. If dividends are higher, it means \\nthat we make more money on our Delta hedge and thus the cost of hedging is less and the \\noption premium will be less. \\n5.6 RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE  GREEKS \\nOther than those already described where, for example, the Vega and Gamma of calls and \\nputs are equal, and the relationship between the Delta of a call and that of a put – all of 79 Option Sensitivities:  Greeks \\nwhich can be derived directly from the model-free put–call parity formula – there exist other \\nrelationships between the Greeks that we discuss here. Firstly, consider the equation, known \\nas the Black–Scholes PDE, derived using the assumptions of the theory, \\n1 /Theta1 +rS/Delta1 +  σ 2 S2/Gamma1 =rV (5.5)2 \\nThis relationship  sho ws the trade-off between movements in the underlying asset (Delta and \\nGamma) and the time decay (Theta) of a European option. Here V represents the value of the \\ncall or put. \\nLet’s take the case of a trader Delta hedging a long position in a European call option, C.A \\nlong position in a call option will require a short position in the underlying stock: the initial \\nDelta hedge involves selling /Delta1 of the underlying S, and the global Delta of the position (long \\noption, short Delta: C −/Delta1S) is then zero. If the underlying spot price goes up, then the Delta \\nof the call goes up. In order for the trader to keep his portfolio Delta neutral, he has to sell \\na quantity of stock equal to the increase of the global Delta. Alternatively, if the underlying \\nstock price decreases, the Delta of the call decreases, which makes the global Delta negative; \\nthen the trader buys more stocks to maintain the Delta of the portfolio null. When one buys a \\ncall and eliminates dynamically the ﬁrst-order spot risk (i.e. global Delta is equal to zero), he \\nbuys the stocks when the spot price decreases and sells it when the spot price increases, thus \\nmaking proﬁt from these variations. This is referred to as being long the Gamma. At the same \\ntime, the time value of the option decreases; this is due to the fact that Theta is negative. The \\nholder of a call option is then long Gamma and short Theta. The opposite is true for a seller of \\na call option. \\nWe get the same results for put options. Indeed, the holder of a European put, P, applies \\nan initial Delta hedge by buying /Delta1 of the underlying stocks. The position P +/Delta1S has zero \\nDelta. If the stock price goes up, the Delta of the put goes up although it is still negative; \\nthis makes the global Delta positive, which means that stocks have to be sold to rebalance \\nthe global Delta to zero. If the underlying stock price goes down, the global Delta becomes \\nnegative since the put Delta decreases. Then one has to buy stocks to keep the portfolio Delta \\nneutral. Here again, when Delta hedging a long position in a put, one buys when the stock \\nprice is cheap and sells when it is expensive. And since the time value of a put decreases, one \\nbuying a put is long Gamma and short Theta. This relationship is clear in formula (5.5), and \\nis discussed in the following exercise. \\nExercise Ania Petro va is\\n  a Russian vanilla options trader. One of her Delta-neutral portfolios is \\ncomposed of shares of Gazprom as well as options on this stock. The portfolio daily global \\n/Theta11d =−1, 000 RUB. Assuming a realized volatility σ of 16%, what would the daily P&L \\nof Ania be if the stock moves by ±2% during one trading day? \\nDiscussion Let δ\\n/Pi1 denote the change in the portfolio value. Then, \\n1 δ/Pi1 =/Theta1 ×δt +/Delta1 ×δS + /Gamma1 ×δS2 \\n2 80 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nHere, Ania is managing a Delta-neutral portfolio, which means that /Delta1 =0. Therefore \\n1 δ/Pi1 =/Theta1 ×δt + /Gamma1 ×δ S2 \\n2 \\nThis means  that  for a realized annual volatility of 16%, the loss due to /Theta1 is equal in absolute \\nterms to the gain due to the /Gamma1. In other words, the daily P&L breakeven occurs when the √ \\nspot \\nmoves by σ 1d =σ/ 252 =1%. \\n12−1, 000 ×1 + =0 ×/Gamma11d ×σ1d2 \\nwhich implies  \\n12×/Gamma11d ×σ1d =1, 000 2 √ \\nSince  252\\n is approximately equal to 16, Ania loses money on a daily basis when |δ S|< \\n1% and makes positive P&L when |δ S|> 1%. Note that the /Gamma1 −P&L is only dependent \\non the absolute value of the spot’s move and not on its direction. \\nIn this case |δ S|=2%, then the daily P&L is as follows: \\n1 P&L 1d =−1, 000 ×1 + × /Gamma11d ×δ S2 \\n2 \\nThen \\n1 P&L 1d =−1, 000 ×1 + × /Gamma11d ×(2 ×σ1d)2 \\n2 \\nOr equivalently \\n12P&L 1d =−1, 000 ×1 +4 × ×/Gamma11d ×σ1d2 \\nThis implies  that  \\nP&L 1d =−1, 000 ×1 +4, 000 =3, 000 RUB \\nAnia makes an  overall proﬁt of 3,000 RUB due to the large move of the underlying spot \\ncompared to its realized volatility. \\n5.7 VOLGA AND V ANNA \\n5.7.1 Vega–Gamma (Volga)  \\nVega–Gamma, or V olga, is the second-order sensitivity of the option price to a movement in the \\nimplied volatility of the underlying asset. When an option has such a second-order sensitivity \\nwe say it is convex in volatility, or has Vega convexity. ITM and OTM European options do \\nexhibit Vega convexity, as seen in Figure 5.10 and discussed in Chapter 4 on volatility, but \\nthese can be captured in the skew. \\nOther structures we will  see later, for example Napoleons that are discussed in Chapter 13, \\nexhibit a lot of Vega convexity and will result in losses if we do not use a model that prices \\nthis correctly. The reason is that as volatility moves, a Vega convex payoff will have a Vega \\nthat now moves with the volatility and this must be ﬁrstly priced correctly and then hedged 81 Option Sensitivities:  Greeks \\naccordingly. We will see this in detail in our discussion of cliquets in Chapter 13 and also in \\nvolatility derivatives in Chapter 16. \\n5.7.2 Vanna \\nVanna is also  a second-order sensitivity. It measures the sensitivity of the option price to \\na movement in both the underlying asset’s price and its volatility. We can thus think about \\nVanna as the sensitivity of the option’s Vega to a movement in the underlying’s price, also \\nas the sensitivity of an option’s Delta to a movement in the volatility of the underlying. As \\nsuch, Vanna gives important information regarding a Delta hedge by telling us by how much \\nthis hedge will move if volatility changes. It also tells us how much Vega will change if the \\nunderlying moves and can thus be important for a trader who is Delta or Vega hedging. If \\nVanna is large, then the Delta hedge is very sensitive to a movement in volatility. \\n5.8 MULTI-ASSET SENSITIVITIES \\nIn addition to all the Greeks mentioned above, we have others relating to the cross effects \\nbetween the assets and the sensitivity to the correlation between the assets. \\nCross Gamma  \\nThe\\n cross  Gamma  is the sensitivity of a multi-asset option to a movement in two of the \\nunderlying assets. Let us assume that an option is written involving more than one underlying, \\nS1,S2,..., SN , then the cross Gamma involving Si and Sj (two of the underlyings) is given \\nby \\n∂2 Price( Si ,Sj ) = /Gamma1Si ,Sj ∂Si ∂Sj \\nThis mixed term can be thought of as the effect of a movement in Si on the Delta sensitivity \\nof the option to Sj , meaning that, in multi-asset options, it is possible that the Delta w.r.t. one \\nasset can be affected by a movement in another underlying asset even if the ﬁrst asset has \\nnot moved. These are important in the context of basket options in Chapter 7 on correlation, \\nand also dispersion in Chapters 8 and 9, and generally in the context of almost all multi-asset \\noptions. Correlation Delta  \\nThe\\n correlation  Delta  is the ﬁrst-order sensitivity of the price of a multi-asset option to a \\nmove in the correlations between the underlyings. This must be looked at for every multi-\\nasset derivative, if for no other reason than to see which position the derivative has w.r.t. the \\ncorrelation (i.e. are we long or short the correlation between the assets?) and to assess the \\nmagnitude of this sensitivity (is it highly sensitive to correlation or not?). The correlation \\nsensitivity in all the products we will see is discussed in detail on a product by product basis. \\nThis arises from the fact that correlations vary over time, and that a multi-asset product’s \\nsensitivity to the correlation between a pair of underlying assets can vary as the other parameters \\n(for example, the underlying’s prices) change. /radicalbigg \\n/radicalbigg 82 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nWhile correlation is not as easily tradeable as underlying assets or even volatility, there are \\nsome methods of trading correlation that we will discuss in Chapter 7, and the correlation \\nsensitivity of an option or a book of options is thus meaningful in the context of reducing this \\ncorrelation exposure on either level. Many correlation risks we will see are not completely \\nhedgeable, if at all, and in many cases traders must resort to maintaining dynamic margins for \\nthe unhedged correlation risk. Knowing the sign and magnitude of correlation sensitivity is \\nagain necessary in this case. \\nSome multi-asset  deri vatives are convex in correlation, meaning that the second-order effect \\non the price from a movement in the correlation is non-zero and needs to be taken into account. \\n5.9 APPROXIMATIONS TO  BLACK–SCHOLES AND GREEKS \\nIn this section we look at some simple approximation formulas for vanilla prices and some \\nGreeks. The idea is to derive formulas that are simple enough to be quickly calculated mentally. \\nWe leave the derivations of these for Appendix B, section B.1. It is also a good opportunity \\nto put together some of the issues we have covered so far in terms of what the Greeks mean \\nin reality and their relationship to pricing. To begin, we look at the case of zero rates and \\ndividends. V ega and  Price\\n  \\nStarting with an approximation  of  the BS Vega given by \\nT − t  VATM ≈ S × 2π \\nthis comes  from  approximating the distribution function N /prime(d1) appearing in Vega V = √ \\nSN /prime(d1) T . Now we make the claim that an ATM call option Vega does not depend on \\nthe level of volatility. This is because the second-order volatility sensitivity, V olga, is zero (or \\nvery close to it) in line with the almost linear graph seen in Figure 5.10. If the ATM call option \\nis linear in volatility, then if we know Vega, its price is easily obtained as \\nT − t  Price ATM call ≈ σ × VATM = σ × S × 2π \\nOne can understand  this from the fact that Vega is the sensitivity of the price to a move in \\nvolatility, the ATM call’s Vega does not depend on where the volatility is, so the above formula \\nholds for all sigma, in particular it holds for σ = 1%. If we were to write a Taylor series like \\nthe one for Delta in equation (5.1) but as a function of σ , then the second term will in this \\ncase be zero, and the price is just Vega times the level of volatility. The derivations appearing \\nin this section are explained mathematically in section B.1 in Appendix B. \\nFor the remainder  of this section, we assume that S = 100%. Next we add the useful and \\nquite accurate approximation \\n1 √≈ 0 .4 \\n2π 83 Option Sensitivities:  Greeks \\nIf we are using percentages, then we know that the ﬁrst-order approximation for Vega of an \\nATM call is given by \\n√ \\nVATM call ≈ 0.4 T − t  \\nand the  call  price is approximated by \\n√ \\nPrice ATM call ≈ 0.4 × σ × T − t  (5.6) \\nwhere, in both  of these, the values obtained are percentage prices. Similar approximations \\nexist in the literature, for example Brenner and Subrahmanyam (1988). As an example of this \\nformula, let’s ask the following question: What is the Vega of a 1-year ATM call option with \\nan implied volatility of 32%? \\nThe Vega of  an ATM does not depend on the level of volatility, and we can approximate it √ \\nwith the\\n formula above as Vega = 0.4 × 1 = 0.40 of 1% for a 1% movement in vol, in basis \\npoints Vega is 40 bp. \\nThe price of the call is then approximately V × σ = 0.4 × 32% = 12.8%. The accuracy \\nof these approximations and those to come are shown in comparison to the real values in \\nTable 5.1. \\nExercise Assuming a v\\n olatility of 20%, can you give a quick estimation for the price of a 1-year \\nEuropean at-the-money (ATM) call option? Also, what would you say concerning the \\ncheapest between a basket composed of two 1-year ATM European calls and a single ATM \\ncall option expiring in 2 years? \\nDiscussion Concerning the pricing\\n  of European at-the-money calls, you should be able to give an \\naccurate straightforward estimation using formula (5.6). Then, the price of a 1-year ATM \\nEuropean call is as follows: \\n√ \\nC1y = 0.4 × σ × 1 = 0.4 × 20% × 1 = 8% \\nNow, still using  the same approximation, we get the price C2y of an ATM European call \\noption with a maturity of 2 years: \\n√ \\nC2y = 0.4 × σ × 2 \\nOn the other  hand, the price B1y of a basket composed of two ATM European calls having \\na maturity of 1 year is equal to \\n√ √ \\nB1y = 2 × C1y = 2 × 0.4 × σ × 1 = 2 × C2y \\nThis implies that B1y > C2y. We can conclude that a 2-year ATM European call option is \\ncheaper than two 1-year ATM European calls. /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg 84 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n1.2 0.8 0.4 \\n0 \\n−0.4 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 120% 130% 140% \\nActual Delta Approximate formula of Delta 110% \\nFigure 5.13 A plot of the actual Delta and that of its approximation given by the formulas present in \\nthis section. As is clear, around the ATM point the approximation is almost exact. The further we move \\naway from the money the more it diverges from the actual Delta. \\nDelta Now we \\n look at an approximation of Delta. \\n1 1 1 /Delta1call =N (d1) ≈ +√ d1 ≈ + 0.4d 12 2π 2 \\n√ \\nThe call\\n is ATM in the example above, and so d1 =σ T /2 =16%, then the approximation \\nfor the ATM Delta in this case is given by \\n1 √ 1  /Delta1ATM call = + 0.2σ T = + (0.2  ×32%) =0.564 2 2 \\nIn\\n the case  of away-from-the-money calls, we have to include the term ln S/K in d1.I nt h i s \\ncase, yet another useful approximation that would allow one to approximate this mentally is \\ngiven by \\nln S \\nK ≈1 −  K \\nS \\nthe accurac y of  which depreciates quickly the further K is from S, as is clear in Figure 5.13. \\nAs an example, let’s assume that the call is 5% OTM, that is, S =100% and K =105%. Then \\nln(S/K ) =−4.88% and the approximation is 100% −105% =−5%. \\nAs another  e xample, given the price of an ATM call option and its Delta, what is the \\nﬁrst-order approximation for the price of a 2% OTM call? \\nShifting strike is lik e shifting spot (the opposite way), so let δ S =−2% and check \\nOTM Price ≈AT M Price +/Delta1 ×δ S /bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright  /bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright \\nzeroth order ﬁrst order /bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright /bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright /vextendsingle /vextendsingle /vextendsingle /vextendsingle \\n/bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright 85 Option Sensitivities:  Greeks \\nThis comes from writing a Taylor series of the price of a call option of strike K around the \\npoint K = S \\n∂C C (K )  = C(S) +(K − S) +··· ∂ S S=K Call at strik e K ATM Call strike S \\nDelta at S=K  \\nNext we look at more sensitivities and make use of the above formulas for Delta along with \\nsome replication arguments to obtain some more approximations. \\nDividend Sensitivity  \\nThese\\n formulas  assume  zero dividends and zero interest rates, but what is the sensitivity of the \\nprice of the call to a 1% increase in dividends? \\nThe answer  is  that if we are selling the call, then we will be long /Delta1 of stock. If we hold \\nthe stock then we receive the dividends, and this makes our cost of hedging less; therefore the \\nprice of the call will be less. So we know that a 1% increase in dividends will lower the call \\nprice, but by how much? We hold /Delta1call of stock, and therefore from our hedge, a 1% increase \\nin dividends gives us \\n/Delta1call ×(Dividend increase) = 0.564 ×1% = 56.4b p \\nso the call price  will go down by 56.4 basis points. \\nRho Now, what  are\\n  the effects of interest rates on the price of a call option? Here we have a double \\neffect: on the one hand, if rates go up by 1% then it will cost us, as we saw before, more money \\nto borrow the amount we require to buy our /Delta1call hedge. But, on the other hand, the option \\nprice must be discounted, bringing the price down as rates go up. So, from the ﬁrst effect we \\nwill need to now borrow an additional \\n/Delta1call ×(Rate increase) = 0.564 ×1% = 56.4b p \\nbringing the price  up by 56.4 bp, but a ﬁrst-order discounting brings the price down by \\nRate increase  ×  T ×Price = 1% ×1 ×12.8% = 12.8b p \\nThus, overall a  1% increase in rates increases the price by 56.4 −12.8 = 43.6 bp. Given that, \\nas we saw in the section on Rho (rate sensitivity), the call price is almost linearly increasing \\nTable 5.1 Actual values of price and Greeks under Black–Scholes and their \\napproximations using the described formulas. \\nBlack–Scholes Approximation Approximation Error  \\nPrice\\n 12.71% 12.8% 9bp \\nVega 39.4 bp 40  bp 0.6bp  \\nDelta 0.5635 0.564 5bp \\nGamma 1.231% 1.25% 19bp \\nRho 43.64 bp 43.6  bp 0.04bp 86 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nas rates go up, we can extend this to say that the approximate price of an ATM call with vol \\nand maturity, as in the example, is given (when rates are now 4%) by \\nC = C(0)  + 0.436% × 4 = 14.54% \\nwhere C(0) is the call price approximation above with zero rates assumed. \\nTo this we  have added the rate sensitivity for a 1% increase in rates times 4 to represent \\nthe fact that rates are now 4%, not zero.

Table 5.1 \\nsummarizes these results in comparison to their actual values. 6 \\nStrategies Involving Options \\nThe peak efﬁciency of knowledge and strategy is to make conﬂict unnecessary. \\nSun Tzu \\nIn this chapter, we examine the different portfolios, also called option strategies, that can be \\ncreated by traders or investors using stocks and vanilla options on these stocks. In the ﬁrst \\nsection, we will present two popular elementary hedging strategies using a stock and a single \\noption on the same stock. Traders and fund managers holding stocks in their portfolios can use \\nthese strategies to get protection against their stock prices going down; we will see how they \\ncan do so by buying protective puts or writing covered calls. We then move on to option spreads \\nand combinations, which are trading strategies combining different positions in call and put \\noptions; these strategies can be used for speculative purposes and enable investors to realize a \\nproﬁt that perfectly ﬁts their market expectations, but can also be used for hedging purposes. \\nOptions spreads  are  deﬁned as positions in two or more options of the same type (two calls \\nor two puts). A vertical spread is a strategy that consists of buying and selling two options \\nof the same type with the same maturity date but having different strikes. Section 6.2 is \\ndedicated to explaining and analysing the risks of vertical spreads, whereas the other types \\nof spread trading strategies are presented in the following section. After doing so, we discuss \\nhow we can take speculative positions in the volatility of the underlying asset by adopting \\ncombinations. These strategies consist of buying (or selling) calls and puts with the same \\nmaturity date and on the same underlying stock. We ﬁnish this chapter with a discussion on \\nvolatility models to be applied to these trading strategies in order to fully understand their risks. \\n6.1 TRADITIONAL HEDGING STRATEGIES \\n6.1.1 Protective Puts \\nA\\n protecti ve put  is a portfolio composed of a European put option and the underlying stock. \\nBeing long a protective put is equivalent to holding a share and a put option on the same \\nshare; this is one of the most popular trading strategies involving a single vanilla option on \\nan underlying stock and the stock itself. In Figure 6.1 the solid line illustrates the proﬁt \\nfrom a long position in a protective put, whereas the dashed lines show the relationship \\nbetween the proﬁt and the stock price for the individual assets composing the portfolio. As \\nthe name suggests, the motivation for buying a protective put is mainly for hedging purposes. \\nTo enlighten the aim of this strategy, let’s consider the case of a fund manager holding \\n10,000 stocks of Danone bought at an average price of 50 euros. He is worried about the \\nmarket going down during the next 3 months but still does not want to sell his shares. The \\nactual stock price of Danone is equal to 72 euros. The fund manager decides to buy 10,000 \\n3-month European puts on Danone with a strike price of 68 euros. Each put premium is equal \\nto 1.50 euros. Here, the trader is holding 10,000 protective puts on Danone that protect him \\nfrom a big decrease in his shares’ stock price. Indeed, the fund manager is assured to sell his \\nshares for at least 66.5 euros (exercise price minus premium). In fact, buying protective puts 88 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n50% \\n0% \\n−50% 0% 50% 100% 150% \\nLong Put Long Stock Long Protective Put \\nFigure 6.1 Proﬁt patterns from holding a protective put. \\nenables an investor to ﬁx the maximum loss he could potentially suffer if the market goes \\ndown. The maximum downside risk is then equal to Put premium + S0 − K, where K is the strike \\nprice. \\nOn the other  hand, an investor holding a large amount of stocks that have already increased \\ncan immediately sell his shares to realize the proﬁt and be protected against future market \\nrisk. In this case, the transaction fees incurred for selling the whole portfolio can be high; \\nthe investor can then choose to buy an equivalent amount of puts (at a potentially lower fee) \\nthat enable him to lock a level of proﬁt (protection against downside risk) and still have the \\npossibility to realize additional return in the case of a favourable market. Buying protective \\nputs serves as insurance against a market going down. \\nThe payof f of  a protective put is as follows: \\nProtective Put payoff (K, T) = S(T) + Put payoff (K, T) \\nand from  this,  we can easily compute the Greeks associated with protective puts and perfectly \\nanalyse the risks involved in trading such strategies. By taking derivatives both sides with \\nrespect to the stock price, we get the Delta of a protective put, which is equal to 1 + /Delta1Put(K, T). \\nTherefore, one buying a protective put is long the stock price since the Delta of this strategy \\nis always positive (its values ﬂuctuate between 0 and 1). Also, the Vega and Gamma of \\na protective put are respectively equal to the Vega and Gamma of the put composing the \\nstrategy. \\nIt is interesting  to note that a protective put strategy is equivalent to buying a call option. \\nIndeed, the proﬁt patterns of a long position in a protective put emphasized in Figure 6.1 have \\nthe same general proﬁt patterns as those discussed in Chapter 3 for a long call position. An \\neasy way to understand where this result comes from is to look at the put–call parity explained \\nin Chapter 3: \\nPut( K, T)  + S(0) − D = Call( K, T) + Ke−rT \\nwhere Put( K, T) and Call( K, T) are, respectively, the premiums of a European put and call \\nwith strike K and maturity T, S(0) is the stock price at time 0, r is the risk-free interest rate \\nand D is the present value of the future expected dividends occurring during the life of the 89 Strategies Involving Options \\noptions. This equation shows that a long position in a protective put (= Put( K, T) + S(0)) \\nis equivalent to holding a call plus investing a cash amount of money (= Ke−rT + D)a tt h e \\nrisk-free rate. \\n6.1.2 Covered Calls  \\nA\\n covered call  is a portfolio that consists of holding a European call option and short selling \\nthe underlying stock. Its payoff is as follows: \\nCovered Callpayoff (K, T) = Call payoff (K, T) − S(T) \\nWriting a co vered call is another popular hedging strategy that is equivalent to holding a \\nshare and selling a European call option on the same share. This strategy is employed by \\nfund managers because it enables them not only to get protection from a small decrease in the \\nstock price, but also to increase their portfolio returns in the form of income from the option’s \\npremiums. In Figure 6.2 the solid line illustrates the proﬁt from a short position in a covered \\ncall, whereas the dashed lines show the relationship between the proﬁt and the stock price for \\nthe individual assets composing the portfolio. Selling covered calls is a strategy that can be \\nused in many situations. First, consider a trader holding some shares of a speciﬁc company and \\nwho strongly believes that the stock price of this company will increase in the long term. She \\nis not willing to sell those shares; however, she thinks that the stock price is going to decline \\nin the short term. She decides to sell short maturity European calls on these underlyings and \\nuse their premium to compensate for the potential expected stock price decrease. In this case, \\nif expectations are correct and the stock price slightly goes down in the short term, the sold \\ncalls are not exercised by the buyer and the negative stock performance is balanced by the \\npremium of the calls. Alternatively, if the stock price goes up signiﬁcantly enough to make \\nthe call ﬁnish in-the-money, she will have to deliver the stocks she is holding. She wants to \\nhold the stocks in her portfolio; therefore, as soon as the stock price becomes higher than the \\nstrike, she rolls-over the position by buying an identical call and issuing another call on the \\nsame underlying with the same maturity date but with a higher strike. \\n100% \\n50% \\n0% \\n−50% \\n−100% 0% 50% 100% 150% \\nLong Stock Short Call Short Covered Call \\nFigure 6.2 Proﬁt patterns from writing a covered call. 90 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nHere, we can see that writing covered calls is not a pure hedging strategy since it only \\nprovides the investor with a small insurance against a stock price decline. Figure 6.2 shows \\nthat selling covered calls does not provide protection against a signiﬁcant decrease in stock \\nprices. The premium earned is then too small compared to the loss caused by a market \\ncrash. If one wants to generate signiﬁcant income from selling options, he has to sell call \\noptions with lower strike. But in the case the market goes up, the investor’s maximum proﬁt is \\nlocked to Call premium + K − S0. This is why traders tend to roll-over their positions; but even \\nrolling-over can be difﬁcult to achieve for many reasons linked to transaction fees or the call \\noption’s liquidity. Many institutions manage their pension funds by taking short positions in \\ncovered calls to increase their return in stable markets where volatility is low. If the stock price \\nﬂuctuates slightly, the out-of-the-money calls are not exercised and the calls’ prices provide \\nthe fund managers holding shares with additional income. If we rearrange the put–call parity, \\nwe get the following result: \\nCovered Call(K  , T ) = Put( K , T ) − [K e−rT + D] \\nHere, we can  see that writing a covered call with strike K and maturity T is equivalent to \\nselling a European put option with the same strike and maturity, and investing an amount of \\ncash (= K e−rT + D) at the risk-free interest rate. This result can also be deducted from the \\nproﬁt patterns of a short position in a covered call, emphasized in Figure 6.2, which are similar \\nto those discussed in Chapter 3 for a short put position. Therefore, a trader selling a covered \\ncall is then subject to the same risks involved in selling the equivalent put option. The seller \\nof a covered call is then long the stock price since the Delta of a covered call is equal to the \\nDelta of the equivalent put (its values vary between −1 and 0). Also, the Vega and Gamma of a \\ncovered call are respectively equal to the Vega and Gamma of the call composing the strategy. \\nIf volatility decreases, the price of the covered call decreases, and one writing covered calls is \\nthen short volatility. \\n6.2 VERTICAL SPREADS \\n6.2.1 Bull Spreads \\nBull\\n spreads  are  the most popular vertical spread strategies and correspond to a bullish view \\non the market. Investors use bull spreads when they believe an underlying asset value is going \\nto increase above a speciﬁc level K1 but will not be able to reach a level K2 (with K2 > K1). In \\nthis case, investors are willing to capture the positive performance of the underlying asset and \\npay a smaller premium for this option; bull spread strategies answer this scenario perfectly. \\nA bull spread  strategy can be constructed using call options (bullish call spread) or put \\noptions (bullish put spread). Let’s ﬁrst examine the case of bull call spreads that consist of \\nbuying a call with strike K1 and selling a call on the same underlying with strike K2 higher \\nthan K1. Both options have the same maturity T .

Note that holding a bullish call spread \\nimplies buying a call at a price higher than the premium of the sold call since both calls have \\nthe same maturity and K1 is lower than K2. Therefore, holding a bull call spread requires an \\ninitial investment equal to Call (K1, T )− Call (K2, T ). A bull spread strategy limits not only \\nthe downside risk but also the upside since the maximum payoff that can be received by the \\nholder is equal to K2 − K1. The proﬁt patterns shown in Figure 6.3 are obtained by deducting \\nthe price of the bull spread from the strategy payoff. \\nThe bull call  spread is considered to be a double-sided hedging strategy. The price received \\nfrom selling the call with strike K2 is used to partially ﬁnance the premium paid for the call \\nstruck at K1. Consequently, the investor long the call with the lower strike price hedges the \\nrisk of losing the entire premium. On the other hand, the ﬁnancial risk associated with the \\nwritten call is reduced by the long call position. If the call with the higher strike price expires \\nin-the-money, the loss incurred is offset through exercising the purchased call with the lower \\nstrike. However, it is important to note that the written call limits the maximum proﬁt for the \\nstrategy to K2 − K1. \\nA bull spread  strategy can also be realized by combining a short position in a put struck at \\nK2 and a long position in a put struck at K1. Both puts are on the same underlying asset and \\nhave the same maturity date. The resulting portfolio is called a bull put spread. The strategy \\nis said to be bullish since the idea is to gain proﬁt from selling a ﬁrst put struck at K2 and \\nexpecting the stock price to increase. Then the seller limits the downside risk by buying a put \\nwith a lower strike. The payoff of a bull put spread is given by \\n⎧ ⎨ K\\n1 − K2 if ST ≤ K1 \\nBull Put Spread payoff = ST − K2 if K1 < ST < K2 ⎩ 0i f ST ≥ K2 \\nThe solid line in Figure 6.4 shows the proﬁt from a bull spread strategy realized by combining \\na short position in a put struck at 120% and a long position in a put struck at 80%. The proﬁt \\npatterns given by this ﬁgure are similar to those shown in Figure 6.3. However, it is important \\nto note that the payoff of a bull put spread is always negative, whereas the payoff of a bull \\ncall spread is always positive. This is due to the fact that an investor holding a bull put spread 92 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n30% 20% 10% \\n0% \\n−10% −20% −30% 0% 40% 80% 120% 160% \\nLong Put struck at 80% Short Put struck at 120% Bull Put Spread 80%–120% \\nFigure 6.4 Proﬁt patterns from a bull spread using put options. \\nstrategy is in fact selling a product and receives a global premium equal to Put (K2, T )− Put \\n(K1, T ). This represents the maximum proﬁt he could get and occurs if the underlying stock \\nprice ends above K2. Otherwise, the investor holding a bullish put spread strategy starts losing \\nmoney, which is why the payoff is negative. On the other hand, an investor performing a bull \\nspread strategy using call options is buying a product at a price Call( K1) − Call( K2) and starts \\nto get paid (positive payoff) when the price of the underlying stock increases. We can then \\nconclude that a bull spread strategy can be achieved through buying bullish call spreads or \\nselling bullish put spreads. \\nConcerning the risks  involved in trading bull spreads, it is crucial to understand these \\nstrategies because they are used as components for more sophisticated structured products \\n(described further in this book) such as capped cliquets or other payoffs involving digitals. To \\nmake it simple, we will base our risk analysis on the case of bullish call spreads. Indeed, a bull \\ncall spread and a bull put spread involve the same risks. Figure 6.5 shows the Delta of a call \\nspread composed of a long position in a call struck at 80% and a short position in a call struck \\nat 120%, with respect to the underlying stock price. The shape of the curve reminds us of the \\n1 \\n0.5 \\n0 \\n−0.5 \\n−1 \\n−1.5 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% \\nDelta of Call Spread (long) Delta of OTM Call (short) Delta of ITM Call (long) \\nFigure 6.5 The Delta of an 80–120% call spread and Deltas of the two calls that form this call spread. 93 Strategies Involving Options \\n0% \\n–0.4 –0.3 –0.2 –0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 \\n25% 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 225% Vega of ITM Call Vega of OTM Call Vega of Call Spread \\nFigure 6.6 The Vegas of an 80–120% call spread and the two calls. Being long the 80–120% call \\nspread means being long the 80% strike call and short the 120%. As is clear in the graph, the Vega of \\nthe call spread is the difference between the two Vegas as we are long the Vega of the 80% call and short \\nvolatility on the 120% call. \\nshape of the Gamma of vanilla options analysed in Chapter 5. Also note that the Delta of a \\nbull call spread is always positive, which proves that the holder of the bull spread strategy is \\nalways long the stock price. The strategy is indeed bullish since a higher stock price increases \\nthe value of the bull spread. \\nThe Gamma  and  Vega of bull call spreads are more difﬁcult to manage since their sign \\nchanges on the basis of movement in the underlying’s price. The point at which the Vega of \\na call spread changes sign is around (K1 + K2)/2. If the stock price is below this breakeven \\npoint, the Vega of a call spread is positive and it becomes negative for stock prices above this \\npoint. The Vega of a bull call spread 80–120% is illustrated against the spot in Figure 6.6. \\nAs is clear  in the graph, the Vega of the bull call spread is the difference between the two \\nVegas as one is long the Vega of the 80% call and short volatility on the 120% call. In the case \\nof a ﬂat forward, meaning the zero dividends and rates assumption, the Vega changes sign at \\nthe 100% point. In the general case, the Vega changes sign around the forward, which we note \\ncould be several percent away from the 100% ATM point. Traders have to be cautious when \\nmanaging the Vega of call spreads, especially around the forward. \\nAs for the  skew effect on the bull spread strategy, buying a bull call spread implies buying \\na call with a lower strike K1 and selling a call with a higher strike K2. Because of the skew, \\nthe call struck at K1 is priced with a volatility σ1 that is higher than the volatility σ2 linked \\nto the call struck at K2. Taking into account the skew effect means that the holder of a bull \\ncall spread buys a call with an expensive volatility and sells a call with a cheap volatility. \\nTherefore, skew makes the bull spread more expensive; the buyer of the spread is long skew. \\n6.2.2 Bear Spreads \\nBear\\n spreads  are  vertical spread strategies that have a similar payoff mechanism compared to \\nbull spreads but correspond to a bearish view on the market. Investors use bear spreads when \\nthey believe an underlying asset value is going to decrease below a speciﬁc level K2 but will 94 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n0% \\n–30% –20% –10% 0% 10% 20% 30% \\n40% 80% 120% 160% \\nLong Put struck at 120% Short Put struck at 80% Bear Put Spread 80%–120% \\nFigure 6.7 Proﬁt patterns of a bear spread using put options. \\nnot be lower than another level K1 (with K2 > K1). Investors are then willing to capture the \\nmoderate negative performance of the underlying asset and pay a smaller premium for this \\noption. \\nAs is the  case for bull spreads, a bear spread strategy can be constructed using call or put \\noptions. Let’s ﬁrst examine the case of bear put spreads which consist of buying a put with \\nstrike K2 and selling a put on the same underlying with strike K1 lower than K2. Here, we \\nare still dealing with vertical spreads, so both options have the same maturity T . The bear put \\nspread payoff is as follows: \\n⎧ ⎨ K\\n2 − K1 if ST ≤ K1 \\nBear Put Spread payoff = K2 − ST if K1 < ST < K2 ⎩ 0i f ST ≥ K2 \\nFigure 6.7 shows the proﬁt that could be made by performing a bear spread strategy using \\nputs struck at 80% and 120%. The dashed lines indicate the proﬁts from the positions in \\ncalls taken separately; the proﬁt from the whole bear spread strategy shown by the solid line \\nconstitutes the sum of the two proﬁts given by the dashed lines. Note that holding a bearish \\nput spread implies buying a put at a price higher than the premium of the sold put since both \\nputs have the same maturity and K1 is lower than K2. Therefore, holding a bear put spread \\nrequires an initial investment equal to Put( K2, T )− Put( K1, T ). \\nA bear spread  strategy limits not only the upside risk but also the downside since the \\nmaximum payoff that can be received by the holder is equal to K2 − K1. The proﬁt patterns \\nshown in Figure 6.7 are obtained by deducting the price of the bear spread from the strategy \\npayoff. The premium received from selling the lower strike put offsets the premium paid for \\nthe put with the higher strike. Thus, the risk associated with losing the premium paid for the \\nlong put is (partially) reduced and the position hedged. \\nOn the other  hand, a bear spread strategy can also be realized by combining a long position \\nin a call struck at K2 and a short position in a call struck at K1, both calls being on the same \\nunderlying asset and having the same maturity date. The resulting portfolio, called a bear call \\nspread, is said to be bearish since it is based on the idea of making proﬁt from selling a ﬁrst \\ncall struck at K2 and expecting the underlying stock to go down. Then the seller limits the \\nupside risk by buying a call with a lower strike. The payoff of a bear call spread is given by 95 Strategies Involving Options \\n0% \\n–30% –20% –10% 0% 10% 20% 30% \\n40% 80% 120% 160% \\nLong Call struck at 120% Short Call struck at 80% Bear Call Spread 80%–120% \\nFigure 6.8 Proﬁt patterns of a bear spread using call options. \\nthe following formula: \\n⎧ ⎨ 0i f\\n  ST ≤K1 \\nBear Call Spread payoff = K1 −ST if K1 < ST < K2 ⎩ K1 −K2 if ST ≥K2 \\nThe solid line in Figure 6.8 shows the proﬁt from a bear spread strategy realized by combining \\na long position in a call struck at 120% and a short position in a call struck at 80%. The \\nproﬁt patterns given by this ﬁgure are similar to those shown in Figure 6.7. However, it is \\nimportant to note that the payoff of a bear call spread is always negative whereas the payoff \\nof a bear put spread is always positive. This is due to the fact that an investor implementing a \\nbear call spread strategy is in fact selling a ﬁnancial product and receives a global premium \\nequal to Call( K1, T ) −Call( K2, T ). This amount represents the maximum proﬁt he could get \\nand it occurs if the underlying stock price ﬁnishes below K1. Otherwise, the investor holding \\na bearish call spread strategy starts losing money, which is why the payoff is negative. On \\nthe other hand, an investor performing a bear spread strategy using puts is buying a product \\nat a price Put( K2) −Put( K1) and starts to get paid (positive payoff) when the price of the \\nunderlying stock decreases. We can then conclude that a bear spread strategy can be achieved \\nthrough buying bearish put spreads or selling bearish call spreads. \\nAs for the  risks involved in trading bear spreads, to keep it simple we will base our risk \\nanalysis on the case of bear put spreads. First, let’s analyse the Delta of a bear put spread: \\nBear Put Spread  =Put( K2, T ) −Put( K1, T ) \\nSo, taking the ﬁrst derivative with respect to S, we get: \\n/Delta1Bear Put Spread =/Delta1Put( K2 ,T ) −/Delta1Put( K1 ,T ) \\nAnd since /Delta1Put( K ,T ) =/Delta1Call( K ,T ) −1, then: \\n/Delta1Bear Put Spread =/Delta1Call( K2 ,T ) −/Delta1Call( K1 ,T ) =−/Delta1Bull Call Spread \\nKeeping in mind the Delta analysis of a bull call spread described in the previous section, \\nwe can see that the Delta of a bear put spread is always negative; which proves that one holding \\na bear spread strategy is always short the stock price. The strategy is indeed bearish since a 96 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nlower stock price increases the value of the bear spread portfolio. Similarly, after deriving the \\nbear put spread with respect to σ , we get: \\nVegaBear Put Spread =VegaPut( K2 ,T ) −VegaPut( K1 ,T ) \\nAnd since VegaPut( K ,T ) =VegaCall( K ,T ) we have \\nVegaBear Put Spread =VegaCall( K2 ,T ) −VegaCall( K1 ,T ) =−VegaBull Call Spread \\nThe values of Gamma and Vega of bear put spreads are the opposite values of Gamma and \\nVega of bull call spreads (with equivalent strikes) analysed in the previous section. Here again, \\ntraders have to be cautious when managing the Vega of call spreads because they can change \\nsign as the underlying moves. \\nAs for the  skew effect, buying a bear put spread implies buying a put with a strike K2 and \\nselling a put with a lower strike K1. In the presence of an implied volatility skew, the put \\nstruck at K1 is priced with a volatility σ1 that is higher than the volatility σ2 linked to the put \\nstruck at K2. Taking into account the skew effect means that the holder of a bear put spread \\nbuys a put with a cheap volatility and sells a put with an expensive volatility. Therefore, skew \\ndecreases the price of a bear spread. \\n6.3 OTHER SPREADS \\n6.3.1 Butterﬂy Spreads  \\nThe butterﬂy spread  is considered to be a neutral vanilla option-trading strategy. It is a \\ncombination of a bull spread and a bear spread with the same maturity. The butterﬂy spread \\noffers a limited proﬁt at a limited amount of risk. There are three strike prices specifying the \\nbutterﬂy spread and it can be constructed using calls or puts. A butterﬂy spread can be bought \\nby an investor who believes that the underlying asset will not move by much in either direction \\nof the spot by the expiry of the options. \\nUsing call options,  a butterﬂy spread constitutes a long position in a call struck at a lower \\nprice, a short position in two calls with intermediate strikes, and long a call struck at a \\nhigher price. Butterﬂy spreads are adapted to scenarios where the stock price matures around \\nthe intermediate strike. The payoff of a butterﬂy spread constructed using call options is as \\nfollows: \\n⎧ ⎪ 0if\\n  ST ≤K1 ⎪ ⎨ ST −K1 if K1 ≤ST ≤K2Butterﬂy Spread payoff = ⎪ K3 −ST if K2 ≤ST ≤K3 ⎪ ⎩ 0i f ST ≥K3 \\nassuming K2 =(K1 +K3)/2. \\nFigure 6.9 sho ws the proﬁt from a long butterﬂy that can be constructed by buying one lower \\nstriking in-the-money call at 60%, writing two at-the-money calls and buying another higher \\nstriking out-of-the-money call at 140%. One buying this butterﬂy spread receives a positive \\npayoff and pays an initial investment equal to: \\nButterﬂy Spread premium =C(K −/epsilon1) −2C(K ) +C(K +/epsilon1) \\nwhere C(K )  is the price of a vanilla call with maturity T and struck at K . 97 Strategies Involving Options \\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 120% 140% 160% 180% \\n–30% –20% –10% 0% 10% 20% 30% \\nLong Call struck at 60% Short 2 Calls struck at 100% Long Call struck at 140% Butterfly Spread 60%–140% \\nFigure 6.9 Proﬁt patterns of a butterﬂy spread 60–140% using call options. \\nThe proﬁt patterns drawn in Figure 6.9 are obtained by deducting the butterﬂy spread \\npremium from its payoff. Note that the maximum payoff occurs when ST = K and is equal \\nto /epsilon1. We could give the example of an investor who believes the S&P 500 index will end \\nexactly 5% below its level today in a year from now, so this strategy allows us to make the \\nbutterﬂy spread around the strike K = 95% and pick an epsilon that reﬂects how much we \\nwant to pay for this structure. In this case, a butterﬂy spread becomes a bearish product and \\nmost importantly, as discussed in Chapter 4, this speciﬁc three-option combination enables \\nthe holder to capture the curvature of the implied volatility skew. We should also note that the \\nholder of a butterﬂy spread (Figure 6.10) is bearish on the volatility of the underlying. Low \\nvolatility expectations translate to low expectations in the movement in the underlying and, if \\nrealized, the butterﬂy spread will make a proﬁt. This structure can also be replicated using put \\noptions as follows: \\nButterﬂy Spread premium = P(K − /epsilon1) − 2P(K ) + P(K + /epsilon1) \\nwhere P(K )  is the price of a vanilla put with a maturity T and struck at K . That is to say, the \\nholder of a butterﬂy spread is long the K − /epsilon1 strike put, short two puts at strike K and long \\nanother put at strike K + /epsilon1. \\n0% 40% 80% 120% 160% \\n–20% –30% –10% 0% 10% 20% 30% \\nLong Put struck at 80% Short 2 Put struck at 100% Long Put struck at 120% Butterfly Spread 80%–120% \\nFigure 6.10 Proﬁt patterns of a butterﬂy spread 80–120% using put options. 98 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 120% 130% 140% 150% \\n–30% –20% –10% 0% 10% 20% 110% \\nLong Call struck at 70% Short Call struck at 90% Short Call struck at 110% \\nLong Call struck at 130% Condor Spread \\nFigure 6.11 Proﬁt patterns of a condor spread using call options. \\n6.3.2 Condor Spreads  \\nThe condor  spread  is similar to the butterﬂy spread strategy except that it involves four \\ndifferent strike prices, compared to the three strikes of a butterﬂy spread. This strategy can be \\nconstructed using calls or puts. Like butterﬂy spreads, condor spreads are entered when the \\ninvestor thinks that the underlying stock will not rise or fall much by expiration, again bearish \\non the volatility of the underlying. Using calls, a condor spread constitutes a long position \\nin a call struck at a lower price K1, a short position in a call with a ﬁrst intermediate strike \\nK2, a short position in a call with a second intermediate strike K3, and long a call struck at \\na higher price K4. Condor spreads are adapted to scenarios where the stock price matures \\naround the intermediate strikes. The payoff of a condor spread constructed using call options \\nis as follows: \\n⎧ ⎪ 0if\\n  ST ≤ K1 ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ S\\nT − K1 if K1 ≤ ST ≤ K2 \\nCondor Spread payoff = K2 − K1 if K2 ≤ ST ≤ K3 ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ K\\n4 − ST if K3 ≤ ST ≤ K4 ⎪ ⎩ 0i f ST ≥ K4 \\nNote that K2 − K1 = K3 − K2 = K4 − K3 = 2/epsilon1. One buying this condor spread receives a \\npositive payoff and pays an initial investment equal to: \\nCondor Spread premium = C(K − 3/epsilon1) − C(K − /epsilon1) − C (K + /epsilon1) + C(K + 3/epsilon1) \\nwhere C(K )  is the price of a vanilla call with a maturity T and struck at K . \\nFigure 6.11 sho ws the proﬁt from a long condor spread can be constructed by buying one \\nlower striking in-the-money call at 70%, writing two calls struck at 90% and 110% and buying \\nanother higher striking out-of-the-money call at 130%. Note that the maximum payoff is equal \\nto 2/epsilon1 and occurs when K2 ≤ ST ≤ K3. The condor spread strategy is difﬁcult to achieve since \\nthe holder has to trade in four different options simultaneously. 99 Strategies Involving Options \\n–20% –10% 0% \\n40% 60% 80% 100% 120% 140% 160% 10% 20% \\nLong Call struck at 100% Short 2 Calls struck at 120% Call Ratio Spread 100%–120% \\nFigure 6.12 Proﬁt patterns of a call ratio spread 100–120%. \\n6.3.3 Ratio Spreads \\nThe ratio spread  is a strategy obtained by combining different quantities of bought and sold \\ncalls, or bought and sold puts. Note that the maturities of the negotiated options are still the \\nsame. There are four kinds of ratio spreads: \\nr Call ratio spread : Long n calls struck at K1 and short m calls struck at K2 r Call ratio backspread : Short n calls struck at K1 and long m calls struck at K2 r Put ratio spread : Long n puts struck at K2 and short m puts struck at K1 r Put ratio backspread : Short n puts struck at K2 and long m puts struck at K1 \\nwhere m > n and K2 > K1. Figure 6.12 presents the proﬁt generated at maturity from a call \\nratio spread strategy. The latter is composed of a long at-the-money call position in the Nikkei \\nindex combined with a short position in two out-of-the-money calls on the same underlying \\nstruck at 120%. At maturity, if the Nikkei performed negatively, the holder of the call ratio \\nspread would have lost a premium equal to Call(100% , T ) − 2 Call(120% , T ). Here, the \\ninvestor is willing to capture the positive performance of the Nikkei but doesn’t believe the \\nunderlying index will reach 120% of its initial value at maturity date. The premium is much \\nlower than the at-the-money call since it is partially offset by the two sold calls. But in the case \\nwhere this market scenario is not realized and the Nikkei performs above 120%, the investor \\nis not protected against the upside risk and could lose much more than the initial investment \\nrequired by the ratio spread. This strategy, which is one of the more complex spreads, is only \\nadapted to a slight increase of the market. The investor is protected against a fallen market but \\nthe upside risk remains. \\n6.3.4 Calendar Spreads  \\nUp to no w we have assumed that all the options used to create the spread strategies expire at \\nthe same maturity date. A calendar spread strategy, also called horizontal or time spread, is \\nachieved using simultaneous long and short positions in options of the same type (both calls \\nor both puts) of the same strike, but different expiration dates. /braceleftbigg 100 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nUsing calls, a calendar spread strategy is constructed through a long position in a call option \\nthat matures at T2 and a short position in a call with maturity T1 lower than T2. Both options \\nhave the same strike price K . All parameters being constant, we know that the price of a call \\noption increases with maturity. This means that performing a calendar spread strategy requires \\nan initial cost equal to Call( K , T2) − Call( K , T1). Note that the value of this strategy is in fact \\nequal to the difference between both options’ time values since the intrinsic values are the \\nsame at any point of time t . \\nIf the in vestor has a bullish view on the underlying asset and believes the stock price will \\nrise consistently in the long term (which explains why he buys the call maturing at T2), the \\nchosen strike will then be higher than the initial stock price. Also, the investor believes that \\nthe underlying value will still be below the strike in the short term. So he buys a call expiring \\nat T1 to partially ﬁnance the premium paid for the ﬁrst call. This results in holding a bullish \\ncalendar spread. \\nA neutral  calendar  spread is said to be a spread with a strike close to the current stock price, \\nwhereas constructing the spread with in-the-money calls results in a bearish time spread. Note \\nthat calendar spreads can also be created by buying a long-maturity put option and selling a \\nshort-maturity put option. The calendar spread strategy can also be used to take advantage of \\nthe volatility spread between the two options. And since the time value of the option with the \\nlower maturity decreases faster than the longer maturity option, the investor could be willing \\nto close his time spread position by selling at a higher price than the initial cost. \\n6.4 OPTION COMBINA TIONS \\n6.4.1 Straddles \\nThe straddle  is  one of the most common combinations and consists of a long position in a call \\nand a long position in a put on the same underlying asset and having the same strike price \\nK and maturity T . K is often chosen around the actual underlying price. The payoff of the \\nstraddle occurs at time T and is described below: \\nK − ST if ST ≤ KStraddle payoff = ST − K if ST > K \\nThe straddle  constitutes  an interesting strategy for an investor who expects a volatile and large \\nmove in the price of the underlying asset, although the direction of this move is unknown. \\nHolding a straddle is characterized by an unlimited proﬁt potential and a maximum loss \\nlimited to the net initial debit required to establish the position. The premium paid for creating \\na straddle is equal to: \\nStraddle = C(K  , T ) + P(K , T ) \\nwhere C (K  , T ) and P(K , T ) are, respectively, the prices of a vanilla call and a vanilla put \\nwith maturity T and struck at K . \\nThe seller of the straddle gets an initial premium to bear the risks linked to a large move in \\nthe stock price. Indeed, the speculative straddle seller expects implied volatility to decrease. \\nHere, the potential loss is unlimited and comes from the fact that the seller is short a call which \\nis always a dangerous position if unhedged. The proﬁt is positive if ST is inside the range \\n[K − Premium; K + Premium]; and the maximum proﬁt occurs when ST is equal to K . 101 Strategies Involving Options \\n40% 60% 80% 100% 120% 140% \\n–30% –20% –10% 0% 10% 20% \\nStraddle Long ATM put Long ATM Call \\nFigure 6.13 Proﬁt patterns of a straddle struck at 100%. \\nThe solid line in Figure 6.13 shows the proﬁt from a straddle realized by combining a long \\nposition in a 1-year at-the-money European call on Alpha and a long position in a 1-year \\nat-the-money put on the same underlying. This strategy is adapted to an investor who feels \\nthat the stock price of Alpha will move signiﬁcantly up or down in the next year. Therefore, he \\npays a premium equal to 19.7% to proﬁt from his expected scenario. Note that the breakeven \\npoints are equal to 100% − 19.7% = 80.3% and 100% + 19.7% = 119.7%. \\nAlso, put–call  parity  says that you can enter into a straddle by buying a call and a put, or \\ntwo calls and sell a stock or two puts and buy the stock. Note that a straddle is very sensitive \\nto volatility. Indeed, the Gamma and Vega of a straddle are positive and two times higher than \\nthe Gamma and Vega of a call. The holder of a straddle is long volatility since this parameter \\nincreases the value of the strategy. On the initial date, the Delta of the straddle is also close to \\nzero: the put and the call Deltas cancel each other. At the money the Delta of the straddle is \\nnot exactly zero, but close. We see this in more detail in Chapter 16 where we describe trading \\nin straddles as a traditional method for trading volatility, even though this method is trumped \\nby newer volatility products described therein. \\n6.4.2 Strangles \\nThe holder  of  a strangle is long a call struck at K2 and long a put struck at K1 lower than \\nK2. Both options have the same maturity T and are often out-of-the-money. The payoff of the \\nstrangle is as follows: \\n⎧ ⎨ K\\n1 − ST if ST ≤ K1 \\nStrangle payoff = 0i f K1 ≤ ST ≤ K2 ⎩ ST − K2 if ST > K2 \\nAs is the case for straddles, strangles are combinations adapted to investors expecting volatility \\nof the underlying stock to increase. Holding a strangle is characterized by an unlimited proﬁt \\npotential and a maximum loss limited to the initial price equal to: \\nStrangle( K1, K2; T ) = C (K2, T ) + P(K1, T ) \\nAn investor w ould prefer to buy a strangle instead of a straddle if he believes there will be a \\nlarge stock move by maturity, i.e. the investor is even more bullish on volatility.

Note that the breakeven points are equal to \\n80% − 5.9% = 74.1% and 120% + 5.9% = 125.9%. \\nStrangles also enable  investors to trade in volatility. It is interesting to note that a strangle \\nis less sensitive to volatility than a straddle. Indeed, the Vega of out-of-the-money options is \\nlower than the Vega of at-the-money options. Then, the Vega of a strangle, which is the sum \\nof the Vegas of the options composing the strategy, is lower than the Vega of a straddle. The \\nholder of a strangle is long volatility since this parameter increases the value of the strategy. \\n6.5 ARBITRAGE FREEDOM OF THE IMPLIED \\nVOLATILITY SURFACE \\nIn practice we can only observe European option implied volatilities, of a ﬁxed maturity, at a \\nﬁnite set of strikes. Let’s label these strikes as K1,K2,..., Km . It is also the case that we can \\nonly obtain these skews for a ﬁnite set of maturities, and let’s call these T1,T2,..., Tn .E v e ni f \\nthe strikes or maturities happened to be very close, the following criteria must be met in order \\nfor the surface to be arbitrage free. The reason we place this section in this chapter is because, \\ngiven a ﬁnite set of European options, checking the surface to be arbitrage free involves some \\nof the options strategies described in this chapter. \\nFirstly, for all  maturities T in the above set, there cannot be any negative call spreads. If \\nthere was a negative call spread this would imply an obvious arbitrage. This is equivalent to \\nwriting that for all j such that 1 ≤ j ≤ m − 1w em u s th a v e \\nC (Kj ,Ti ) − C (Kj +1,Ti ) ≥ 0 , i = 1,2,..., n 103 Strategies Involving Options \\nAn additional restriction on such spreads is that if we were to divide by the difference in \\nstrikes, we must have, for all j where 1 ≤ j ≤ m − 1 that \\nC (Kj ,Ti ) − C (Kj +1,Ti ) ≤ 1 ,  i = 1,2,...,n Kj +1 − Kj \\nAs we will see later, one can approximate a binary payoff using a call spread, and the use \\nof the two closest strikes must yield a value less than 1 for these call prices to be arbitrage \\nfree. To be clear, we use the reference to call prices and implied volatilities interchangeably \\nas they imply the same thing: each call option has an implied volatility taken from the surface \\ndepending on its strike and maturity. \\nThe other  consideration  is the values of calendar spreads, which too must be positive. So, \\nfor all j such that 1 ≤ j ≤ m \\nC (Kj ,Ti +1) − C (Kj ,Ti ) ≥ 0 , i = 1,2,..., n − 1 \\nFor a more  rigorous discussion we refer the reader to Overhaus et al. (2007) and Carr and \\nMadan’s article on the subject (2005). \\nIn addition, all butterﬂy spreads must be positive; for all j where 2 ≤ j ≤ m − 1, we must \\nhave \\nC (Kj −1,Ti ) − Kj +1 − Kj −1 C (Kj ,Ti ) + Kj − Kj −1 C (Kj +1,Ti ) ≥ 0 i = 1,2,..., n. Kj+1 − Kj Kj +1 − Kj \\nThe conclusion of this is that a set of European options, speciﬁed as above, will be arbitrage \\nfree if all these conditions are met. The market for European options is liquid and we do \\nnot expect to ﬁnd simple arbitrages as such in the market data; however, we should concern \\nourselves that any model we do use to capture skew observes these conditions or it will not be \\narbitrage free. The failure of a model’s calibration to meet these conditions is a solid criterion \\nto reject such calibration. Any interpolation between the implied volatilities of two consecutive \\nstrikes in the above set must also observe these conditions to be arbitrage free. 7 \\nCorrelation \\nThe web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together . \\nWilliam Shak espeare  \\nMany payoffs that exist today are based upon the performance of multiple assets. When \\nan option derives its value from the price of multiple assets, the relationships between these \\nassets become important. Correlation gives us the strength and direction of a linear relationship \\nbetween different underlyings, and in this chapter we look at the properties of correlation, both \\nrealized and implied, together with their measurement and uses. We discuss the correlation \\nrisk appearing in multi-asset options and the implications on the pricing and hedging of these \\noptions. We see the impact of correlation on the variance of a weighted portfolio, and the \\nrequired properties of correlation matrices of multiple assets. \\nBasket options,  which  can be considered the simplest of typical multi-asset options, are \\nalso discussed. These serve as excellent examples to combine the concepts of correlation \\nwith previously discussed concepts regarding options and volatility. Quanto options (short for \\nquantity adjustment options) are also discussed. Quanto options are denominated in a currency \\nother than the currency in which the underlying is traded. The chapter ends with a discussion \\nof some methods for trading correlation. \\n7.1 MULTI-ASSET OPTIONS \\nThe derivatives we have seen so far are all based on a single asset, that is, the payoffs are \\ncomputed on the basis of the performance of only one underlying asset, and here we introduce \\nmulti-asset options. These provide exposure to more than one asset, whether to be used to \\nhedge a position in multiple assets, or to serve as a speculative tool on multiple assets. The \\ncreation of such products stemmed from the concept of diversiﬁcation, and there is now a \\nwealth of products structured on multiple underlyings. \\nDiversiﬁcation inv olves combining multiple assets within a portfolio. Pioneer Harry \\nMarkowitz published research on diversiﬁcation and was awarded the Nobel prize in 1990 for \\nhis work (Markowitz, 1952). The central idea is that movements in one asset within a diverse \\nportfolio have less impact on the portfolio and so diversiﬁcation can lower the exposure to \\nan individual asset. When combining assets of a similar type, the diversiﬁcation is known as \\na horizontal diversiﬁcation. An example of this would be a portfolio of various stocks in the \\nS&P 500 index. \\nThe ﬁrst product  that comes to mind is a call option on a basket of stocks, where the call \\noption’s payout at maturity is based on the performance of a (perhaps not equally weighted) \\nbasket of stocks (or indices, or both). By adding multiple assets to such a payoff one reduces \\nthe level of risk through diversiﬁcation; the basket payoff’s intricacies are discussed below. \\nAlthough using multiple underlyings as such serves one purpose, we will also see dispersion \\npayoffs in Chapters 8 and 9 where we make use of relationships between the underlying assets \\nfor different purposes – for example, yield enhancement or increased leverage. /summationdisplay \\n/summationdisplay /summationdisplay 106 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nIn addition to all the previous considerations, we now deal with the extremely important \\nconcept of correlation and its effects because the value of a multi-asset option does not depend \\nonly on the underlying asset’s implied volatilities but also on the correlations between these \\nassets. As we saw in Chapter 4, market prices of liquid options can be used to infer the \\nimplied volatilities of different individual assets. These implied volatilities contain additional \\ninformation about future volatility expectations that is not included in historical volatility, and \\nin the multi-asset case we would ideally have a similar implied correlation , but we do not. \\nThe reason is simple: although we can obtain market quotes for liquid options on many single \\nunderlyings, and infer from these the implied volatilities, there is no liquid market for such \\nproducts in the multi-asset case. Since we can only rarely infer an implied correlation, we \\nmust resort to other methods of deciding which correlation to use when pricing multi-asset \\nderivatives. Correlations change dramatically through time, which makes the use of realized \\n(historical) correlations unreliable, and management of correlation risk a difﬁcult task. \\nPayoffs involving multi-asset  options are sensitive to movements in the various underlyings \\nand so the relationships between the underlyings, which are deﬁned using correlations, have \\nan impact on the hedging of any such options. Because such payoffs are non-linear functions \\nin more than one variable, we have cross-Gamma effects. The cross-Gamma terms tell us how \\nthe Delta of the option w.r.t. one underlying is affected by a movement in another underlying, \\nand also depend on how we deﬁne the correlations between these underlyings. \\n7.2 CORRELATION: MEASUREMENTS AND INTERPRETATION \\n7.2.1 Realized Correlation  \\nRealized correlation  is  the analogy of realized volatility. This is also referred to as statistical \\nand historical correlation. If we use historical data for two variables to compute the realized \\ncorrelation, then this gives us the strength and direction of a linear relationship between the \\ntwo variables. \\nGiven two variables X  and Y , the realized correlation between them is deﬁned as: \\nCov( X, Y  ) E((X −  µX )(Y − µY ))ρX,Y =√ = (7.1)Var( X )V ar( Y ) σX σY \\nwhere Cov is the covariance of X and Y , Var is the respective variance, µX and µY are the \\nrespective means of X and Y and σX and σY are the respective standard deviations of X and \\nY . This equates to \\nE (XY )  − E(X )E(Y )ρX,Y = /radicalbig /radicalbig \\nE (X 2) − E2(X ) E (Y 2) − E 2(Y ) \\nGiven a times  series of observations of two variables (assets), this formula for the correlation, \\nwritten in terms of the values at each observation date i , can be computed as \\nn \\n(xi − x)(yi − y) \\ni =1 ρX,Y = /bracketleftbigg n n /bracketrightbigg1/2 \\n(xi − x )2 (yi − y)2 \\ni=1 i=1  Correlation 107 \\nIn practice, one computes the correlation between two assets using the two series of daily log \\nreturns, not the two series of prices. One can also use the standard returns S(ti +1)/S(ti ) −1, \\nand under normal market conditions and assuming there is sufﬁcient data in the period over \\nwhich the correlation is being computed, the difference can be ignored. \\nA statistical  correlation  computed as such will take on values between −1 and +1. A \\nnegative correlation indicates that, historically, as one variable has moved up the other has \\nmoved down. A positive correlation means that historically both variables have generally \\nmoved in the same direction. The cases of ρ =+1 and ρ =−1 indicate perfect positive and \\nperfect negative correlation respectively. The case of zero correlation means the two variables \\nmove in a generally random manner comparatively. \\nTwo things  must  be noted. Firstly, the use of the word ‘historical’ above is speciﬁc. When \\ndiscussing ﬁnancial assets, although a historical correlation implies a past relationship between \\nthe assets, the same relationship does not necessarily hold in the future. In fact, ﬁnancial \\ncorrelations change through time, and these ﬂuctuations can be quite large. Secondly, we must \\nstress that measuring correlation as such gives us information regarding the linear relationship \\nbetween two variables. Two variables can, for example, have a historical correlation of zero, \\nbut not be independent. \\nWhen computing  historical  correlation using the formula above involving two series of \\ndata (see Figure 7.1), we must ﬁrst settle a few things. Assume that we were computing the \\ncorrelation between two assets for which we had daily price data for as long back as there \\nwere records. How far back would we compute the correlation? Assume we had, for example, \\ncorrelation data dating 5 years back and we wanted to compute a time series of correlation to \\nsee how it changed through time. Would we use a rolling time frame of 1 year (and thus have \\na 4-year series for the correlation) or would we look at how the correlation changed through \\ntime based on a 2-year horizon? In addition to these, should we use the daily data or use \\nperhaps data from every 3 days or weekly (5 days?). \\nTo analyse  the  differences between all of these possibilities we make use of Figures 7.1, \\n7.2 and 7.3. Firstly , we note that these correlations change through time, and this will be \\nthe case for any correlation between ﬁnancial assets. Table 7.1 gives the correlation between \\n115% 110% 105% 100% \\n95% 90% \\n0 1 2 3 0.5 1.5 2.5 \\nFigure 7.1 Two time series each involving a daily observation over the same 3-year period. 108 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n80% 60% 40% 20% \\n0% \\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 \\n60 day rolling correlation 90 day 1 year \\nFigure 7.2 The time series of the 60-day, the 90-day and the 1-year rolling correlation. The correlation \\nis computed based on the daily price of the two underlyings in Figure 7.1. \\nthe assets in Figure 7.1. Here we can clearly see different regimes of correlation. During the \\nsecond year the series appear more correlated compared to the other two. In particular, as both \\nindices crash together before the 2-year point, correlations rise. During a market crash, the \\nrealized correlation between various assets could approach 1 and we can deﬁnitely witness \\nstocks or indices realizing a correlation of above 90%. October 2008, in the wake of the crash \\nof Lehman Brothers, is a good example. \\nThe bottom  ro w of Table 7.1 shows a signiﬁcant difference between correlation computed \\non a daily basis or 3-day basis. In the example of Figure 7.1 this implies that the two series \\n80% 60% 40% 20% \\n0% \\n0 1 2 3 0.5 1 .5 \\n60 day rolling correlation 90 day 1 year 2.5 \\nFigure 7.3 The time series of the 60-day, the 90-day and the 1-year rolling correlation. The correlation \\nis computed on the basis of the price of the two underlyings in Figure 7.1 observed every 3 days. Correlation 109 \\nTable 7.1 The realized correlation of the two series in Figure 7.1. The \\nﬁrst row corresponds to the realized correlation between 0 and 1 year, the \\nsecond between years 1 and 2, and the third between years 2 and 3. The \\nﬁrst column uses daily observations, and the second uses the same data but \\nonly observed once per 3 days. \\nDaily series 3-Day series \\n0 to 1 year 32.56% 46.38% \\n1 to 2 years 54.32% 59.47% \\n2 to 3 years 45.70% 38.42% \\n0 to 3 years 44.47% 88.09% \\nhave the correlated individual daily shocks in the returns, but have far more correlated 3-day \\nreturns. This could be the example of the stocks of two quite similar companies. \\nBefore the 2-year  point in the time series of Figure 7.1, where we see both assets tank \\ntogether, the realized correlation spikes upwards. This is what we observe in reality when a \\nglobal ﬁnancial crisis impacts all the major indices, such as what we observed in October \\n2008. In a sharp market decline as such, where indices and stocks all crash together, realized \\ncorrelations can approach unity. \\nThe most  important  factor is that the series used to compute the correlations should be \\naligned – that is, the set of points of the two time series used should have matching dates. \\nThis becomes problematic when considering assets in different markets; for example, different \\ncountries have different public holidays and one market may be closed while the other is open. \\nThe result is a mismatch in the two time series. To avoid these problems one should consider \\na 3-day or possibly weekly (5-day) series as the sampling points to compute the realized \\ncorrelation. \\nWe note that  in order to obtain a more thorough view of the dependence of two or more \\nvariables than a linear relationship between them, one can use copulas. These will be discussed \\nin detail in the context of pricing hybrid derivatives in Chapter 20. \\n7.2.2 Correlation Matrices  \\nA\\n correlation  matrix  Mρ is a square matrix that describes the correlation among n variables. \\nLet S1(t),S2(t ),..., Sn (t ) denote the time t prices of n assets, and ρi,j the correlation between \\nassets i and j , then the correlation matrix Mρ is given by \\n⎛ ⎞⎛  ⎞ ρ11 ρ12 ... 1 ρ12 ... \\n⎜ ⎟ = ⎜ ρ12 ⎟Mρ = ⎝ ρ21 ρ22 ... 1 ... ⎠ ⎝ ⎠ ... . ... . . .. . . . . . . . \\nwhere the second  matrix emphasizes two properties of correlation matrices: ﬁrstly, that the \\ncorrelation between any asset and itself is 1, therefore all diagonal entries will be 1; secondly, \\nthat this matrix will be symmetric. As is clear from the deﬁnition in formula (7.1), the \\ncorrelation between asset i and asset j must be the same as the correlation between asset j \\nand asset i . \\nThe correlation  matrix  is also necessarily positive deﬁnite. Once the values of the correlation \\nmatrix have been decided, the matrix must be checked to see that it satisﬁes this property. If /summationdisplay \\n/summationdisplay 110 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nthe correlation matrix we assign is not positive deﬁnite, then it must be modiﬁed to make it \\npositive deﬁnite – see, for example Higham (2002). \\nG i v e na ni n d e xo f n stocks  or a basket of n assets S1, S2, ..., Sn with respective weights \\nw1,w2, ..., wn, the realized index correlation (or realized basket correlation) is deﬁned simply \\nas the weighted average of the realized correlation matrix between the components, excluding \\nthe diagonal of 1’s: \\nwiw jρij \\n1≤i< j≤n ρrealized = n (7.2) /summationdisplay \\nwiw j \\ni< j \\nThe weights wi have the constraints \\nn /summationdisplay \\n0 ≤ wi ≤ 1( f o r a l l i = 1, 2, ..., n) and wi = 1 (7.3) \\ni=0 \\nρij is the realized correlation between components i and j, and again, although we may \\ncompute each of these separately, the overall matrix of correlation between the components \\nof the index must be positive deﬁnite. \\nAssuming we ha ve computed each of the pairwise correlations ρij in the formula using data \\nfrom a period [0, T], then this represents the weighted-average realized correlation between \\nthe n components of the index for the period [0, T]. For this to have any meaning, the pairwise \\ncorrelations must all be computed over the same period. \\nTo compute  the  sensitivity of an option to a speciﬁc correlation pair, one can bump the \\ncorrelation between them by 1%, check that the correlation matrix is still valid, and reprice \\nthe option to see the difference. If we want to see the effect of an overall move in correlations \\nby 1%, we will need to bump the entire matrix of correlations to see what the effect would be \\non the price if the average correlation increases by 1%. The average (off-diagonal) correlation \\nin such a correlation matrix of n assets is given by \\n2 \\nn(n − 1) 1≤i< j≤n ρij \\nIn this case we are interested in the off-diagonal elements as the diagonal elements remain 1 at \\nall times, and increasing each of these elements by 1% will increase this average off-diagonal \\ncorrelation by 1%. Again, before recomputing the price using the bumped correlation matrix, \\nwe should check that this matrix is still a valid correlation matrix. The difference in price \\n(divided by the size of the shift) will give us the overall correlation sensitivity of the option. \\n7.2.3 Portfolio Variance \\nNo\\nw that we  have seen some properties of correlation, we go back to the basis of Markowitz’s \\nportfolio theory (Markowitz, 1952) and look at a portfolio of n assets S1, S2, ..., Sn to see the \\nimplications of correlation on the variance of this portfolio. This allows us to make a link \\nbetween volatility and correlation. /summationdisplay \\n/summationdisplay /summationdisplay \\n/summationdisplay /summationdisplay \\n/summationdisplay Correlation 111 \\nLet Ri be the usual return of the ith asset. Then the expected return of the portfolio, RP,i s \\ngiven by \\nE(RP) = wi E(Ri) \\ni \\nwhere wi is the weight of the ith asset in the portfolio, and the variance of the portfolio is \\ngiven by \\n2 2 2σP = wi σ + 2 wiw jσiσ jρij i \\n1≤i≤n\\n 1≤i< j≤n \\nwhere σi is the volatility of the ith asset (and σi 2 its variance), and ρij is the correlation between \\nassets i and j. Written differently \\nn n \\nσP2 = wiw jσiσ jρij (7.4) \\ni=1 j=1 \\nwhere ρ ij = 1f o r i = j. \\nTo see the  effect of correlation on portfolio variance, take the two-asset case as an example, \\nand assume that both of two assets A and B have an expected rate of return of 5% and each \\na volatility of 20%. If the correlation between A and B is 0.4, then the above formula gives \\na volatility of 16.73% for the equally weighted portfolio in A and B. The 20 stock analogy \\ninvolving a correlation of 0.2 and the same volatility of 30% for all will give an equally \\nweighted portfolio variance of less than half the individual variances. \\nAs long as  the correlation in the above formula is less than 1, holding various assets that are \\nnot perfectly correlated in a portfolio will offer a reduced risk exposure to a speciﬁc asset. \\n7.2.4 Implied Correlation \\nAlthough there  isn’ t an analogy of implied volatility for correlations, we can in practice still \\ndeﬁne an implied correlation. The usefulness of such implied correlation is subject to debate, \\nbut trying to ﬁnd some method of implying correlations is necessary to say the least. The \\nmarket for European options on pairs of underlyings or baskets is not liquid so we cannot \\nextract an implied correlation between the underlyings from these prices. However, let us \\ntake the case of an index for which we have both European options on the index itself as \\nwell as on each of the underlyings composing the index. Then using market quotes, we can \\ninfer an implied correlation that is a measure of the dependence between the components of \\nthe index. \\nn \\n2σ 2 \\nindex − wi σ 2 \\ni \\nρindex \\nimplied = \\n2 /summationdisplay i=1 \\nwiw jσiσ j (7.5) \\n1≤i< j≤n \\nwhere n is the number of components, wi is the ith component’s weighting in the index, σindex \\nis the implied volatility of the index and σi is the implied volatility of the ith component of \\nthe index. In the literature, deﬁnitions of implied correlation such as this appear in Alexander \\n(2001). To obtain the implied correlation over a T-day period, we must use the implied /summationdisplay /summationdisplay \\n/summationdisplay /summationdisplay 112 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nvolatilities of options with time to maturity T . In this case we make use of ATM volatilities \\nthroughout; however, we discuss below the correlation skew that involves implied volatilities \\nof different strikes. \\nTo understand  where  this came from we go back to the variance of a portfolio and we regard \\nthe index as a portfolio of n assets with different weights. \\nn \\n2 2σindex = wi σi + 2 wi w j σi σ j ρi, j \\ni =1 1≤i< j ≤n \\nThe implied correlation of an index is deﬁned as the correlation ρimplied that, when used in \\nplace of the n(n − 1) individual correlations ρi, j , will result in the same portfolio variance: \\nn \\n2 index  σindex = wi σ 2 + 2 wi w j σi σ j ρimplied i \\ni =1 1≤i\\n < j≤n /bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright \\nIn a portfolio  or basket of stocks for which we apply this formula, all weights are assumed to \\nbe constant, whereas in the case of an index, the weights vary as the components of the index \\nvary, thus making this an inexact deﬁnition. \\nHowever this does  still have some implications and uses. Assume that we have a basket \\nof stocks for which we wish to infer an implied correlation. Assume further that these stocks \\nall belong to the same index. The idea is to follow a simple parameterization involving a \\ncoefﬁcient λ which relates realized and implied correlations of the index, and in turn use this \\ncoefﬁcient and also the realized correlations between the index components to infer speciﬁc \\nimplied correlations. Firstly, compute the realized correlation of the index in conjunction with \\nformula (7.2), and the implied correlation using formula (7.5), then solve for λ in the equation \\nindex index /parenleftbig index /parenrightbig \\nρimplied = ρrealized + λ 1 − ρrealized (7.6) \\nNow take tw o stocks A and B, both of which are in the same index I, for which we have liquid \\nEuropean options on both the index I and its components and, in turn, obtain the value of λ. \\nWith this we can then reapply formula (7.6) and solve for the left-hand side using the realized \\ncorrelation of A and B on the right-hand side along with the index λ. Assume, for example, \\nthat the value of λ implied from the index is 10%, and the realized correlation between A and \\nB was 40%, then using the formula we ﬁnd an implied correlation of \\n40% + 10%  × (1 − 40%) = 46% \\nIf the inde x λ was 25%, then this along with a realized correlation of 70% between A and B \\ngives an implied correlation of 77.50%. \\nSection 7.5 discusses  methods for trading correlation, and we will see that it is possible to \\ntrade an average implied correlation of index components. Thus, since this can potentially be \\nhedged, using the implied index λ to infer implied correlations for basket subsets of an index \\nwill on average reﬂect the values of the implied correlations that cannot otherwise be inferred. \\nIn relevance to pricing, and since this average implied correlation can potentially be hedged, \\nit makes sense that there is some form of implied correlation, and not realized correlation, in \\nthe case where there is similar exposure to the correlation pairs between many of the index \\nconstituents. \\nSell-side desks  of  multi-asset options will typically be structurally short correlation. This \\nis due to the fact that the sale of many of the multi-asset products we will see result in short Correlation 113 \\npositions in the correlations between the underlyings for the seller. The implied correlations \\nseen above, in particular those computed using formula (7.6), will be higher than the realized \\ncorrelation levels (assuming the implied λ is positive). In the case where realized correlation \\nis higher than implied, one may want to sell correlation at a level at least equal to the realized \\ncorrelation. Even in the case where the implied correlation is higher than the realized, the seller \\nof a multi-asset option who is to assume upon the sale a negative position in the correlation, \\nmay want to increase the level slightly further. This will depend on three factors: ﬁrstly, the \\nsensitivity of the option in question to the correlation parameter; secondly, the overall level to \\nwhich the trader is already exposed to the correlations between the assets of this option; and, \\nthirdly, the level to which the trader needs to be aggressive on the trade. \\nIn the e xample of the Altiplano option of Chapter 15, the option has higher sensitivity \\nto the correlations between the underlying assets, compared to the basket option described \\nbelow where this sensitivity is lower. In some cases, such as options on the outperformance \\nof one asset versus another (discussed in Chapter 9), the seller of the option will be long the \\ncorrelation between the two assets. The decision will then be: At what level should we buy \\ncorrelation? In all cases, the trader will need to manage unhedgeable or residual correlation \\nrisk using dynamic margins which depend on the notional size of the trades and the levels of \\ncorrelation sensitivity. \\n7.2.5 Correlation Skew  \\nAssume that we  have two assets and that we have implied volatility skews for each of them, and \\nalso an implied volatility skew for vanilla options on the basket. To have an implied volatility \\nskew for basket options means that, for a ﬁxed maturity, we can ﬁnd quotes for the prices of \\nbasket options with different strikes. If this were the case and we used formula (7.5) to imply \\na correlation at each strike where we used the implied volatility for the basket and the two \\nconstituents taken from each implied skew at this strike, would the implied correlation be the \\nsame? The answer is that it is not necessarily so. This curve, when plotted against the strikes \\nused to compute it at each instance is known as a correlation skew. \\nBecause we ha ve an implied volatility skew for the index as well as each component, the \\nconcept of having one implied correlation parameter loses meaning and we may want to look \\nat the correlation skew. Having such a skew can explain at least part of the increase in implied \\nvolatilities of OTM puts. The reason is that a lower strike holds a higher implied volatility, \\nbut also we expect in this region that if the index is tanking it means that its components are \\nalso tanking and thus their correlation will rise. Many exotic products have correlation skew \\nexposure in the sense that as the underlying assets move, the correlation sensitivity can vary \\nsigniﬁcantly. \\nIf we parameterize  the skew in the same manner as we did the implied volatility skew, we \\nneed the 90% strike, the ATM and the 110% strike options on the index and each component. We \\ncan then have a 90–100–110 parameterized correlation skew. To see the impact of correlation \\nskew on a price one needs to use a model that knows about correlation skew in order that it \\nshows this additional risk. This effect can be seen, for example, using a stochastic correlation \\nmodel (generates a correlation skew). Or, to avoid adding additional model complexity, use \\nthe standard correlation and add a price adjustment by estimating the impact of the correlation \\nskew on the price. \\nOn this note,  we point out the implying correlations as discussed above may also give rise \\nto a correlation term structure. Using index and component option implied volatilities for /summationdisplay \\n/bracketleftBigg /bracketrightBigg /summationdisplay 114 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\ndifferent maturities may imply different levels or correlations. What is most important is that \\nwhatever correlation we imply, we must use the correct maturities for the relevant implied \\nindex and component volatilities. From a modelling perspective, having a correlation term \\nstructure is typically less computationally intense than a correlation skew. To go deeper into \\nthe concept of a correlation skew, and have a meaningful method to see this in a model, we \\nwill need to look at copulas. These are discussed in Chapter 20 in the context of pricing hybrid \\nderivatives. \\n7.3 BASKET OPTIONS \\nThe basket option has already been mentioned and here we discuss it in more detail. Start with \\nn assets S1, S2, ..., Sn and construct a portfolio or basket consisting of these underlyings, each \\nwith its own corresponding weight. The weights wi do not need to be equal but must satisfy \\nthe criteria laid out in equation (7.3). Deﬁne the value of a basket of n assets Si at time T as \\nn \\nBasket( T ) = wiSi (T ) \\ni=1 \\nwhere the weights wi satisfy the criteria of equation (7.3), then the payoff of a call option on \\nthe basket (the basket call) with maturity T is given by \\nn \\nBasket Call payoff = max 0 , w iSi (T ) − K \\ni=1 \\nA basket option is therefore an option whose payoff is contingent on the performance of such a \\nbasket. To avoid confusion, the reference to basket options is where the weights of each of the \\nunderlyings, upon which the payoff is computed, is known at the outset. This is in comparison \\nwith what we see later as a distinct set of options called Rainbows, where the weighting is \\nspeciﬁed at maturity and is based on the relative performance of the various assets. As such, \\nthe basket is different from an index in that the weights in a basket stay the same, whereas in \\nan index they can change as the components of the index move. \\nThe logic  behind  formula (7.4) and the example following it apply to the basket options. \\nThe decreased overall variance (and thus decreased volatility) implies that a call option on \\na basket represents the cheaper alternative to take a view on the portfolio of assets. This \\ninvolves only one transaction to gain exposure to multiple underlyings and thus lower trans-\\naction costs.  It  is also because of this multi-asset feature, and the problems that could poten-\\ntially arise  from having to deliver multiple underlyings, that multi-asset options are generally \\ncash settled. When pricing an ATM basket call option we only need the ATM volatilities of the \\nrespective underlyings. If the product is to be Vega hedged, then ATM options on the various \\nunderlyings will be used, and thus the ATM volatilities used in the pricing. We also need a \\ncorrelation between the underlyings, and, in the case of the basket option, the seller of the \\noption is short this correlation. If we assume that each of the underlyings is log-normal, then \\nwe get stuck because the sum (basket) of log-normal random variables is not log-normal; how-\\never, we assume  that the normal market circumstances can apply the usual portfolio variance \\nof formula (19.1) to approximate the volatility of the basket. The assumptions behind this are \\ndiscussed in Appendix B, section B.2. \\nIn practice,  and  for pricing purposes, this is not sufﬁcient; however, it does allow us to look \\nat the effect of correlation. As we can see in the variance formula, the correlations are always Correlation 115 \\n12% 10% \\n8% 6% 4% 2% 0% \\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 \\nFigure 7.4 The price of an ATM basket call option based on two assets as a function of the correlation \\nbetween the two assets. \\naccompanied by positive coefﬁcients and so an increase in correlation implies an increase in \\nthe overall basket volatility, as demonstrated earlier. Since call options have positive Vega, the \\nseller of the basket call is thus selling the basket volatility which, in turn, implies that the seller \\nis short the correlation between the underlyings. Note the non-linearity of the basket option’s \\nprice sensitivity to a movement in correlation through Figure 7.4. If we were to assume that the \\nonly impact that correlation has on a basket option is that which it has on the basket volatility, \\nthen it is fair to say that the basket call option’s correlation sensitivity is given by \\n∂Bask et Call price ∂Basket Call price ∂σbasket = × ∂ρ ∂σbasket ∂ρ \\n∂σbasket = Vbasket call × (7.7)∂ρ \\nwhere σbasket is the volatility of the basket. The last term on the right-hand side is positive but \\nis not a linear function in correlation. \\nOther methods  e xist whereby the basket is modelled as a single log-normal asset so that \\nthe Black–Scholes formula can be applied. This breaks down to ﬁnding the equivalent mean \\nand variance, and thus involves moment matching. One can ask: given a set of variables all of \\nwhich are log-normal and for which we know the mean and variance, can we ﬁnd an equivalent \\nlog-normal random variable that has the same mean and variance as the weighted basket of \\nthese log-normals? In Brigo et al. (2004) the authors use a moment-matching method to give \\na closed formula equivalent log-normal process for the basket. \\nIn practice,  we  may want to simply apply a simulation-based pricing method. Once the \\nvolatilities and correlations are speciﬁed, basket options can then be priced using Monte \\nCarlo simulation correlated log-normal random variables. In the case where there is skew \\ndependence, for example an OTM basket call option, skew models will be needed. The seller \\nof an OTM basket call option is short the individual OTM implied volatilities of the underlying \\nassets, and as skew increases these values go down, thus the seller of the OTM basket call \\noption is long the individual skews. The opposite holds in the case of a put option on the \\nbasket with respect to skew, but again the seller of a put is short volatility and thus the seller \\nof the basket put is short both the volatilities of the underlyings and the correlations between 116 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nthe underlyings. The seller of a basket call or put option is essentially short the covariance of \\nthe underlying assets. \\nOne methodology  to  handle basket skew is to use an index skew as a proxy for the basket \\nskew. Assuming that a bank wants to sell a skew-dependent option on a basket of banking \\nstocks, then the skew (or a percentage of the skew, 75% for example) of the banking stocks \\nindex in which these stocks are present can be used as a conservative proxy for the case where \\nthe seller is short skew. One can compare the time series of the volatility of the basket to that \\nof the index to decide the level at which to buy/sell volatility if the basket option’s Vega is \\nto be hedged with options on the index. This becomes necessary when dealing with baskets \\nof underlyings for which we do not have liquid individual underlying OTM European options \\ndata but still need to price skew correctly. In the case where one has sufﬁcient liquid individual \\nunderlying OTM option quotes for the points to which the basket option has Vega exposure, \\nthen the calibration of individual local-volatility models to these skews, and a simulation of \\nthese correlated variables, will sufﬁce. \\n7.4 QUANTITY ADJUSTING OPTIONS: “QUANTOS” \\n7.4.1 Quanto Payoffs \\nAn\\n asset  is  described as a quanto if it is denominated in a currency other than the one in which \\nit is normally traded. So a quanto option is an option denominated in a currency other than the \\ncurrency in which the underlying is traded. Cashﬂows are computed from the underlying in \\none currency but the payoff is made in another. The idea behind the quanto is that it handles the \\nrisk to foreign exchange rates which are found in foreign derivatives (those with underlyings \\nin a non-domestic currency). Quantos are immensely traded, and any of the options we have \\nseen can be changed into a quanto option. \\nIn a European  payoff, for example, the strike price is set in the currency of the underlying. \\nTake the example of a European call option on the S&P 500 index which makes its payoff \\nin pounds sterling. Let S(T ) denote the price of the index at maturity, then the payoff of the \\nquanto call option is given by \\nQuanto Call payoff (T ) = FX(0) × max [S(T ) − K , 0] \\nwhere FX(0)  is  the exchange rate at time 0, and this is deﬁned as the domestic currency \\nper one unit of the foreign currency. Note that this is ﬁxed in the above payoff. This option \\ngives the buyer exposure to the upside in the index above the speciﬁed strike, but without \\nthe payout having any exposure to changes in the USD (in which S&P 500 is traded) and \\nGBP (in which the payout is being computed) exchange rate. The payoff can be modiﬁed \\nto include the exchange rate at maturity, FX( T ), however the option will no longer provide \\nprotection against the FX risk. These types of structures are discussed in detail when we look \\nat FX-Equity hybrids in Chapters 17 and 18. \\n7.4.2 Quanto Corr elation  and Quanto Option Pricing \\nLet rstock denote the risk-free interest rate of the currency in which the underlying stock (or \\nindex) is traded, and let q denote the dividend yield of the stock (or index) and σS its volatility. \\nDenote also by σFX the volatility of the exchange rate. If we make Black–Scholes assump-\\ntions, in particular  regarding the log-normality of the underlying process, and also assume a Correlation 117 \\nlog-normal process for the foreign exchange process, then analytical pricing solutions for \\nquanto European options exist. The result is the same as a Black–Scholes formula for the \\nnon-quanto case, using the risk-free rate rstock and dividend yield q, plus what is known as \\na quanto adjustment which accounts for the quanto effect. The adjustment is added to the \\ndividend yield and is given by \\n−ρ quanto · σS · σFX \\nwhere ρquanto is known as the quanto correlation and is the correlation between the underlying \\nequity and the FX rate. Other than the volatility of the underlying equity’s price and the \\nvolatility of the exchange rate, this quanto correlation will also affect the price of the quanto \\noption – even though it is the ﬁxed FX rate at time 0 that is used in the payoff. Let’s be clear \\non the FX rate and quanto, going back to the example of the call option on the S&P 500 index: \\nwhen denominated in GBP, the quanto correlation is the correlation between the USD–GBP \\nexchange rate and not the GBP–USD exchange rate. Note that σFX is the volatility of the FX \\nrate and will be the same for USD–GBP and GBP–USD. \\nLike many equity–equity  correlations, it is hard to correctly obtain an implied quanto \\ncorrelation from market data. If one has a quote for the price quanto option, then because all \\nother parameters are known we can back out a quanto correlation. For this implied correlation \\nto be useable we would need a liquid market for speciﬁc quanto options. In the general case \\nwhere we cannot imply and hedge the quanto correlation risk, the seller of the quanto option \\nwill have to resort to looking at the realized correlation and taking a margin. When computing \\nsuch a correlation from two time series, we do as before and use data of the log-returns for the \\nasset and the log of the FX rate, not the price and exchange rates themselves. \\n7.4.3 Hedging Quanto  Risk  \\nFirstly, and making  use of the above formula, we think about the effect the quanto adjustment \\nhas on the forward. As it appears above, applied to the dividend but with a negative sign, it \\nimpacts the forward in the opposite way from dividends. An increase in the quanto correlation, \\nthe FX volatility or the volatility of the underlying will have the same effect as a decrease in \\ndividends. Lowering dividends increases the forward, and since the seller of a call option, for \\nexample, is short the forward, the seller is thus short the quanto correlation and FX volatility. If \\nwe think about Delta, the seller of a call option will buy Delta of stock, in order to Delta hedge, \\nand is thus long dividends. Since the quanto adjustment has the opposite effect of dividends, \\nthe seller of a quanto call option is short the quanto correlation and FX volatility. \\nThe opposite  will  hold for the seller of the quanto put option because the seller of a put \\nis long the forward. If we want to think about Delta again, we just need to note that the \\nseller of a put option will go short Delta of stock in order to Delta hedge. Thus the opposite \\napplies in the case of put options. One thing to note is that the volatility of the underlying \\nappears in the adjustment, and although the seller of the put option is short the volatility of \\nthe underlying, the quanto effect here has the opposite effect. Generally speaking, the quanto \\neffect will be secondary and the seller of the quanto put will still be overall short the volatility \\nof the underlying. \\nLeaving the formula  aside, we consider how the seller of the quanto call option will Delta \\nhedge. Assume that a trader sells the above call option on the S&P 500 denominated in GBP. \\nThen to hedge, the seller will need to buy Delta of the underlying, which involves selling GBP \\nand buying USD. The seller of the quanto call is thus short the quanto correlation. 118 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nIn general, when turning a more exotic structure into a quanto option, the general trend that \\nwe see among the various structures is that the seller will be long Delta, rather than short, on \\nmany more structures. This means that one would expect an exotics desk to be structurally \\nshort the quanto correlation between various underlyings and the relevant currencies. Using \\nrealized correlation plus a margin is in some ways the best one can do to price this quanto \\nrisk; however, the fact that it cannot be hedged in the market means that the seller will have \\nto essentially sit on this risk. In 2008, for example, the Nikkei index’s quanto correlation \\nappearing in EUR-denominated quanto options rose signiﬁcantly and desks suffered losses \\non this parameter. Although this is an example of where the realized series was misleading \\nand the historical data was not a good predictor of future realized correlation, there was little \\nthat could be done. In the future, desks may take a wider margin when selling this quanto \\ncorrelation. \\n7.5 TRADING CORRELATION \\nHere we discuss two of three possible correlation trading strategies. Traditionally one makes \\nuse of European options on the index and its components and can trade these against each other \\nin the form of straddles. A more speciﬁc and pure correlation trade is the correlation swap. \\nHere we discuss both of these. A third method involves trading variance swaps (or Gamma \\nswaps), again on the index versus the components to get a cleaner exposure than the straddle \\nversion. This method, however, will be considered after our discussion of variance swaps in \\nChapter 16 on volatility derivatives. The other two methods are discussed below. \\n7.5.1 Straddles: Index  v ersus Constituents \\nConsider a trade  where we go long straddles on an index and short straddles on each of \\nthe individual components. Following the formula for portfolio variance and what we have \\nlearned about the effect of correlation on the volatility of an index, we see that the holder of \\nthis portfolio is long the correlation between the index components. In this case the holder \\nof this position is long the average correlation of the index, deﬁned as above, and not the \\nindividual pairwise correlations. \\nThe weights  in  such a strategy must be speciﬁed for the component straddles according to the \\nweights of the index, and will obviously need to be readjusted if the weights change. Straddles \\nare used because a Delta-hedged straddle can provide exposure to volatility, although, as we \\nwill see in Chapter 16, trading straddles does not give a pure exposure to volatility. The idea \\nis that by gaining exposure to just the volatility of the index and those of the components, the \\nspread will leave us with an exposure to correlation. \\nThe variance sw ap, or Gamma swap, provides a purer exposure to volatility, and thus \\ntrading spreads between the variance swaps of an index versus those of the components is a \\nmore transparent method for trading the average correlation in an index. (See section 16.7 on \\nvariance dispersion.) \\n7.5.2 Correlation Swaps  \\nThe\\n correlation  sw ap is an OTC product typically of medium-term maturity between 1 and 3 \\nyears. It allows the investor to obtain a pure exposure to the average correlation among a basket \\nof underlyings. If the basket consists of two assets, then the correlation swap provides exposure Correlation 119 \\nto the pairwise correlation between the two underlyings. The underlyings of a correlation swap \\ncan be any two assets: exchange rates, commodities, equities, etc. – basically any asset for \\nwhich we have observable price data. \\nThe correlation  sw ap consists of a ﬁxed leg and a ﬂoating leg with payments made on \\nthe basis of a prespeciﬁed notional that we denote Ncorr. The ﬁxed leg of the swap pays this \\nnotional times the strike ρstrike (set out in the contract). The ﬂoating leg pays the annualized \\nrealized correlation between the underlying assets of the swap, thus the need for price data \\nfor each underlying. At expiry, the payoff of the correlation swap is given by the difference in \\npercentage points times the notional. For the payer of the ﬁxed leg this is \\nNcorr × (ρrealized − ρstrike) \\nIf the correlation  swap is written on a basket of underlyings then the ﬂoating leg is the average \\ncorrelation computed using formula (7.2), where the basket weights are again constrained by \\nthe conditions of equation (7.3). Each pairwise correlation is computed using the log daily \\nreturns of each underlying. An investor who is short the swap, meaning one who pays the \\nﬂoating level, makes money if the correlation realized is lower that the speciﬁed strike level. \\nThe correlation  sw ap thus provides pure exposure to realized correlation, and appeals to \\ninvestors looking to take a direct view on the future realized correlation and also to those \\nwanting to hedge correlation risk. As discussed earlier, sell-side desks will be structurally \\nshort correlation on a book level because of the sale of multi-asset options, the majority of \\nwhich set the seller of the option short the correlation. Although spread positions in straddles \\nallow one to hedge the average correlation of a basket or index, the risk to pairwise correlations \\nremains, and this can potentially be very large for certain underlyings. The correlation swap \\nprovides a method for the sell side to buy back some of the correlation they have sold, providing \\na counterparty for such a swap can be found. Such counterparties include institutional clients \\nof investment banks, such as hedge funds, who can use the correlation swap to take a view on \\nthe future realized correlation compared to its current market price. Ideally one would be able \\nto enter into such swaps for baskets of underlyings for which pairwise correlation exposure is \\ngreatest. \\nThe problem  with  correlation swaps is that they cannot be replicated or priced in a simple \\nand arbitrage-free manner. The strike of the correlation swap would thus generally be some \\nestimation of future realized correlation. Work on correlation swap replication and pricing has \\nbeen done; for example, Bossu (2005) shows that the fair strike of the correlation swap on the \\nrealized correlation of the components of an index is in fact related to the implied correlation \\n(equation (7.5)) of the components. These problems have left the correlation swap market \\nrelatively illiquid, with those that are traded generally coming from speciﬁc underlyings, for \\nexample the world basket of the EuroStoxx50, the Nikkei and the S&P 500 indices. \\nAssuming that one  were able to trade a correlation swap on the underlyings to which a book \\nis most exposed, this is not the absolute solution. On day 1 of selling an option the trader can \\nknow the correlation sensitivity of the option. However, this correlation sensitivity changes \\nover time. Going back to the example of the basket option, let’s model the basket as one asset \\nand apply a Black–Scholes formula. Just to think about a simple case, we see in equation \\n(7.7) that the bask et call option’s correlation sensitivity is directly proportional to the Vega \\nsensitivity to the basket volatility. As we saw in Chapter 5, the Vega of a call option is sensitive \\nto movements in the underlying – it is, in particular, a function of moneyness. If we draw the \\nanalogy to the basket where we think of the basket’s moneyness compared to the strike of the \\noption, we can expect the correlation sensitivity of the option to change as the underlyings 120 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nmove. Thus hedging such correlation risk using a correlation swap – which obviously has \\na ﬁxed notional – is not the absolute answer to the correlation problem. Better examples of \\ncorrelation sensitivity arise when we discuss dispersion options – for example, a call option \\non the best of two assets. Although the correlation swap doesn’t provide a complete hedge, it \\ncan prove valuable on a book level to at least partially hedge the correlation risk to speciﬁc \\npairs or baskets to which the trader has large short exposures. \\nAnother way to  see the basket sensitivity is to note that the seller of the basket call is in fact \\nshort the covariance of the assets: both the individual volatilities and the correlation between \\nthe underlyings. Generally, the correlation sensitivity of a multi-asset option will move as \\nthe volatilities of the underlying assets change. One way to incorporate this is to consider \\ncovariance swaps, deﬁned analogously, but involving both the correlation between assets and \\nalso their volatilities. However, these will again suffer from the same liquidity problems owing \\nto the lack of a correct replication methodology. Part II \\nExotic Derivatives and Structured \\nProducts 8 \\nDispersion \\nMay the best from your past be the worst of your future. \\nIn the context of multi-asset options, we often encounter the concept of dispersion . In statistics, \\ndispersion – also called statistical variability or variation – is deﬁned by the variability or the \\nspread in a variable or a probability distribution. It measures the extent to which data is spread \\naround a central point. Dispersion effects in multi-asset options appear when its payoff depends \\non the relative performance of the underlying assets to each other; that is, how far the returns \\nof a sample of assets composing a basket are from each other. \\nIn this chapter , we ﬁrst discuss the roles of correlation and volatility in dispersion in order \\nto properly understand it. Then, we focus on worst-of and best-of options, analysing the \\nimpact of these common features on options pricing. Firstly, the payoff description is detailed \\nthrough scenarios, then the risks associated with the pricing and hedging of these derivatives \\nare identiﬁed and analysed. It is imperative to get a handle on these concepts in order to go \\nfurther with the exotic multi-asset structures, including hybrids, discussed later in this book. \\n8.1 MEASURES OF DISPERSION  AND INTERPRETATIONS \\nWhen discussing correlation in Chapter 7, we left the effect it has on dispersion for the separate \\ndiscussion here. In the case of basket options, the correlation between the multiple underlyings \\nhas an effect on the overall volatility of the basket and thus affects the price. In the case of \\nthe basket option, the payoff at maturity is a function of where the basket’s value lies, that is \\nthe weighted average of the terminal values of the underlying assets. Thus, it is not a function \\nof how dispersed the returns are, as it is an option on the average of such returns. Here we \\nwill look at the second effect of correlation, that is, the effect correlation has on the dispersion \\nof the underlyings. In these options the payoff depends directly on how much the underlying \\ndispersed, and we refer to these as dispersion trades. \\nWhen one says  that a basket of assets has a high dispersion, this means that the asset returns \\nare quite different from each other. In other words, a simulation on the stock’s returns will \\nresult in returns far from each other. Thus, uncorrelated returns result in a high dispersion. If \\na trader is long dispersion, this also means that he is short correlation since a low correlation \\nimplies a high dispersion. \\nCommon examples of  measures of statistical dispersion are the variance, standard deviation \\nand interquartile range. V olatility is also a parameter affecting dispersion. In fact, dispersion \\nis an increasing function of volatility: if volatility goes up, the variance of returns goes up, \\nwhich enhances the likelihood of having returns far from their expected value. When a trader \\nis long dispersion, he is therefore long volatility. \\nAs a result  of the sale of multi-asset equity products to clients, the sell-side trader’s book \\npositions in dispersion are thus typically structurally long. The majority of these products \\ninvolve the traders taking short positions in options that have a negative sensitivity to dispersion, /summationdisplay \\n/bracketleftBigg /bracketrightBigg /summationdisplay 124 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nand long positions with positive sensitivity. Put differently, the sale of dispersion products \\ninvolves long volatility and short correlation positions. \\nWe now use  these measures of dispersion to structure some derivatives on dispersion. As \\na ﬁrst example, consider an option on the dispersion of the individual stocks of a basket over \\nthe performance of the equally weighted basket. Let S1,S2,..., Sn be the underlying stocks \\nof the basket, and let R1,R2,..., Rn be their respective returns at maturity T , deﬁned in the \\n1 /summationtextusual manner .  The basket return is given by the average of the returns RB = nn \\n=1 Ri andi \\nthe payoff of the dispersion trade is given by \\n1 n \\nPayoff = |Ri − RB |n i=1 \\nthat is, it is the average of the absolute values of how far each individual return is from the \\nbasket return. There is no global ﬂoor in this payoff as the absolute values (and their average) \\nare all positive. This measure of dispersion is known as the average absolute deviation. \\nA second example of  an option on dispersion has the following payoff: \\nn /summationdisplay 1 n \\nPayoff = max 0 , w i (Perf i − 1) − (Perf i − 1) n i=1 i=1 \\nwhere \\nSi (T )Perf i = Si (0) \\nis the performance of the  i th stock, and the weights wi are \\nPerf i wi = /summationtextn \\n=1 Perf i i \\nAfter moving the terms around this can be written as \\n/bracketleftBigg \\n1/n /summationtextn \\n=1 Perf2 − /parenleftbig \\n1/n /summationtextn \\n=1 Perf i /parenrightbig2 /bracketrightBigg/bracketleftbigg /bracketrightbigg \\niPayoff = max 0 , i \\n1/ni /summationtextn \\n=1 Perf i = max 0 , Variance(Perf) \\nAverage(Perf) i \\nthat is, we have a set of individual performances and the option pays on the variance of this \\nset, geared by the inverse of the average. \\nRelative dispersion,  sometimes  called the coefﬁcient of variation, is the result of dividing \\nthe standard deviation by the mean, and is therefore dimensionless (it may also be presented as \\na percentage). So a low value of relative dispersion usually implies that the standard deviation \\nis small in comparison to the magnitude of the mean. \\nOne can also  have an option on the range, which is a measure of dispersion that locates the \\nmaximum and minimum (these two values form the range), and a simple payoff with the same \\nnotation as above is given by \\nPayoff = max  (Perf i ) − min (Perf i )\\ni=1→ n i =1→ n \\nIf the performances are all the same, then the payoff is zero as the range is just one number, \\nwhich is the case when we have zero dispersion. Again since the maximum will always be \\ngreater than (or equal to) the minimum, this payoff is always positive. /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg \\n/parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg \\n/parenrightbig Dispersion 125 \\n8.2 WORST-OF OPTIONS \\nWe now discuss options on the worst-of and the best-of; they serve as excellent examples to \\ndescribe the effects of dispersion on multi-asset equity options. A worst-of option, also known \\nas an option on the minimum, is, as the name suggests, an option on whichever among a basket \\nof assets performs the worst. \\n8.2.1 Worst-of Call \\nPayoff Description  \\nAssume\\n that we  start with n assets S1,S2,..., Sn , then a worst-of call option has a payoff at \\nmaturity T given by : \\nWO Callpayoff = max [0,min( S1(T ),S2(T ),..., Sn (T )) − K ] \\nwhere K is  a predetermined strike price. Since this option is a call on a worst-of, it has a lower \\npayoff potential compared to a call option on the same underlying basket, then a worst-of call \\nis cheaper than a vanilla basket call (Table 8.1). \\nPricing Formulas for W orst-of Calls \\nClosed formulas  for  these options do exist, and although one would typically value these using \\na Monte Carlo simulation, we present a few of these formulas here. Stulz (1995) gives closed \\nformulas for a worst-of call in the case of two assets, in this case a call option on the minimum \\nof two assets S1 and S2. Other articles from the literature discussing this aspect of pricing such \\noptions include Johnson’s 1987 work on the maximum or minimum of several assets. Under \\nBlack–Scholes assumptions, and assuming zero dividends and the same accrual rate for both \\nstocks, we have \\n√ /parenrightbigg √ \\nWO Callprice= S1N2 γ1 + σ1 √ \\nT , /parenleftbigg\\n \\nln(S2/S1) − 1 σ2 T /σ T ,(ρ1,2σ2 − σ1)/σ2 \\n√ /parenrightbigg √ \\n+S2N2 γ2 + σ2 √ \\nT , /parenleftbigg\\n \\nln(S1/S2) − 1 σ2T /σ T ,(ρ1,2σ1 − σ2)/σ2 \\n−rT N2 /parenleftbig \\n−K e γ1,γ2,ρ1,2 \\nwhere N2(,,) is the bivariate cumulative standard Normal distribution, (see Hull (2003) for \\ndetails and a good way to approximate this). ρ1,2 is the correlation between the two underlying \\nTable 8.1 Scenario observations of the underlying’s performances with respect to initial date, note \\nthe difference in payoffs at maturity between the ATM worst-of call and the ATM basket call. \\nEuroStoxx S&P 500 Nikkei WO call Bask et call \\nScenario 1 − 5% 7% 12% 0% 4.67% \\nScenario 2 3%  12% 10% 3% 8.33% \\nScenario 3 7%  7% 15% 7% 9.67% /parenleftbigg /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg /parenrightbigg \\n/parenleftbigg /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg /parenrightbigg 126 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nassets, and σ 1 and σ2 are the respective volatilities of S1 and S2, \\n√ 12γ1 = ln(S1/K ) + r − T /σ1 T σ12 \\n√ 12γ2 = ln(S2/K ) + r − T /σ2 T σ22 \\n2 2σ = σ12 + σ2 − 2ρ1,2σ1σ2 \\nRisk Analysis First of all,\\n  the holder of a call option has a bullish view on the underlying stocks. The higher \\nthe forward price of the individual stocks, the higher will be the forward price of the worst \\nperforming stock, which will increase the option’s price. Knowing that interest rates increase \\nthe forward price and that dividends and borrow costs decrease the forward price, we can \\nconclude that the worst-of call price is an increasing function of interest rates and a decreasing \\nfunction of dividends and borrowing costs. \\nLet’s discuss  the  Delta in the two asset case. Both assets start at 100%, and as they evolve, \\none of them will perform worse than the other. Looking at the Delta proﬁle, as one of the \\nunderlyings becomes the worst-of, then the Delta sensitivity to this asset will increase for the \\nsimple reason that the call option is on the worst performing asset. \\nWe also ha ve to consider the cross-Gamma effect: in the case of a worst-of call on two assets \\nS1 and S2, both assets start, as always on day 1 at 100%. If stock S2 stays at 100%, but S1 \\nmoves down by 5% to 95%, what happens to our sensitivity to S2 given that it did not move? \\nThe answer is that in relative terms to it being the worst-of the two, the fact that it stayed the \\nsame and is not the best-of, we expect that the further S1 drops the more the Delta on S2 will \\ndrop. \\nIn the general  multi-asset case this is also true. As one asset becomes the worst-of, it picks \\nup Delta and the others lose some Delta. When another name takes over as the worst performer, \\nthe primary Delta effect moves to the new asset. The Delta with respect to the previous worst \\nperformer can go down even if it has not moved, by virtue of the fact that we now have a new \\nworst performer. \\nAs for the  effects of volatility and correlation, a higher dispersion of the returns will likely \\nresult in a lower payoff since the income received by the option’s holder depends on the worst \\nperforming stock. In other words, the worst-of call price decreases if dispersion goes up. This \\nmakes one believe that a higher volatility as well as a lower correlation will result in a lower \\noption price. However, the position in volatility is not this obvious when we are talking about \\na simple worst-of call option. If we keep in mind that volatility increases the price of a call, \\nthen the volatility has two opposite effects on the option price. On the one hand, it increases \\nthe expected payoff of the call; on the other hand, it increases dispersion which lowers the \\nlevel of the worst performing stock and thus decreases the payoff’s potential. \\nThe seller  of  a simple call on the worst performing stock must be cautious with its Vega. \\nMost of the time, dispersion’s effect is dominant and the trader selling this option would be \\nlong volatility. But in some cases, the positive volatility effect on the call offsets the negative \\nvolatility effect on dispersion; then the trader selling a worst-of call will be short volatility. This \\nis typical in a high correlation environment. A common occurrence is that the seller is short \\nvolatility on one underlying, usually the one with the highest volatility, and long volatility on Dispersion 127 \\nTable 8.2 Scenario  observ ations of the underlying’s performances with respect to initial date, note \\nthe difference in payoffs at maturity between the ATM worst-of put and the ATM basket put. \\nEuroStoxx S&P 500 Nikkei WO put Bask et put \\nScenario 1 − 5% −7% −12% 12% 8% \\nScenario 2 3%  12% −10% 10% 0% \\nScenario 3 − 7% 7% −15% 15% 5% \\nthe others. Knowing the direction and magnitude (and the skew position) of the sensitivities \\nto the implied volatilities of the individual underlyings must be established. Options on the \\nindividual underlyings can be used to hedge the Vega sensitivities of the structure to each of \\ntheir volatilities. As the market moves and assets disperse, their respective Vegas will increase \\nor decrease in magnitude, depending on whether they have dispersed towards becoming the \\nworst-of or not, respectively. 8.2.2 Worst-of Put \\nPayoff Description  \\nAssume\\n that we  start with n assets S1,S2,..., Sn , then a worst-of put option has payoff at \\nmaturity T given by : \\nWO Put payoff = max [0,K − min( S1(T ),S2(T ),..., Sn (T ))] \\nwhere K is  a predetermined strike price. \\nSince this option  is a put on a worst-of, it has a higher payoff potential compared to a put \\noption on the same underlying basket. This makes the worst-of put more expensive than a \\nvanilla basket put (Table 8.2). \\nPricing Formulas for W orst-of Puts \\nAs in the  case of a worst-of call we can rely on several approaches. Following the closed form \\nof the worst-of call on the two assets we saw in the previous section, it is interesting to see \\none here for the worst-of put. From the price of a call option on the worst-of two risky assets \\nand the price of assets S1,S2 and the risk-free rate r , with strike K , it is possible to obtain the \\nprice of a call option on the maximum of two risky assets, and the price of a put option on the \\nminimum of two risky assets. Stulz (1995) gives the parity relationship between the worst-of \\ncall and the worst-of put as \\nWO Put price(K ) = e−rT K − WO Call price(0) + WO Call price(K ) \\nTo verify this result consider the  following two investments: \\n• Portfolio A Buy a \\n put on the minimum of S1 and S2 struck at K . \\n• Portfolio B Buy bonds \\n that pay K at maturity T . \\nSell a call option on min( S1,S2) with zero strike. \\nB u yac a l lo p t i o no nm i n ( S1,S2) struck at K . 128 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nIf min( S1, S2) = S1 < K , then Portfolio A pays K − S1, whereas Portfolio B pays K − S1 + \\n0 = K − S1. The second case, min( S1, S2) = S2 < K , follows similarly, so A and B are \\nequivalent. Risk Analysis Firstly, the holder\\n  of a put option has a bearish view on the underlying stocks. The higher \\nthe forward price of the individual stocks, the higher will be the forward price of the worst \\nperforming stock, which will decrease the option price. Knowing that interest rates increase \\nthe forward price and that dividends as well as borrow costs decrease the forward price, we \\nconclude that the worst-of put price is a decreasing function of interest rates and an increasing \\nfunction of dividends and borrowing costs. \\nWith respect  to  the Deltas we have an analogous argument to the case of the worst-of call. \\nConsider the position of a seller of a two-asset worst-of put. The seller will go short Delta of \\nstock on day 1 with the respective Deltas. If we assume that S1 starts to decline and takes the \\nrole of the worst-of, then we expect the Delta on it to increase (in absolute value), and at the \\nsame time the Delta on S2 to decrease (again in absolute value). \\nAs for the  effects of volatility and correlation, a higher dispersion of the returns will likely \\nresult in a higher payoff since the income received by the option’s holder depends on the \\nworst performing stock. In other words, the worst-of put’s price increases if dispersion goes \\nup. A higher volatility as well as a lower correlation will result in a higher option price. As \\nthe market moves, the option will show higher Vega to the volatilities of the underlyings that \\nperform the worst. The magnitude of Vega is also a function of the positions of the asset with \\nrespect to the strike; if the worst performing stock is far from the strike and the option far \\nout-of-the-money, then Vega will be less than if the worst-of is near the strike. \\nThe presence  of  skew, as discussed in Chapter 4, implies that the distribution of the returns \\nof the underlying is skewed with higher probabilities of downward moves than is implied by \\na ﬂat volatility. In the context of the worst-of put that pays on this downside, a higher implied \\nvolatility on the downside will result in a higher price, so an increase in skew will raise the \\nprice of the worst-of put. \\nFrom the model  point of view, and in order to capture the different skew effects, we will need \\nto calibrate a local volatility model to each underlying’s implied volatilities. If the option’s \\npayoff is only a function of the returns of each underlying at maturity, then it is imperative to \\nget that particular skew correct in the calibration and we would use the exact date-ﬁtting model \\ndescribed in section 4.3.3. The Vega hedge consists of a set of European options on each of \\nthe underlyings, and for these to serve as hedging instruments, the model used to price must \\nbe calibrated to them so that it shows risk against them. If there is some form of additional \\npath dependency, such as averaging, then we need to use a form of smooth surface local \\nvolatility calibration described in section 4.3.3 in order to capture the effect of surface at all \\ndates where the payoff is sensitive. Because this is a multi-asset option we will need to do this \\nfor each underlying, and use a correlation matrix that is obtained following the procedures of \\nChapter 7 and taking into account the trader’s position in correlation. \\n8.2.3 Market Trends in  Worst-of Options \\nMany exotic options  traded in the market contain a call feature on the worst performing stock. \\nThey are popular since the worst-of feature makes the call option cheaper and thus has a high Dispersion 129 \\nTable 8.3 Individual  parameter positions for a worst-of option trader. \\nWorst-of call seller  W orst-of put buyer \\nInterest rates  Short  Short \\nBorrowing costs Long Long \\nDividends Long Long \\nV olatility Depends Long \\nCorrelation Short Short \\nSkew Depends Long \\nleverage potential. Traders at banks are usually selling worst-of call options, and this is one of \\nthe reasons they are most of the time long dispersion. Also, an exotic trader is more likely to \\nbuy a worst-of put than to sell it, based on the nature of many retail products that use the put \\nfeature to enhance yields (see Table 8.3). In this case, the trader is again long dispersion. \\nExercise Let A and\\n  B denote two stocks that have an initial price equal to $100. Imagine you can \\nsell a ﬁnancial product C that pays the holder the minimum value between A and B after \\n2 years. Would you sell it for $100? \\nDiscussion To answer  this\\n  question, there is no need to try to ﬁgure out the interest rates, the dividends \\nor the volatility of both stocks. In fact, one needs to know if there is an arbitrage opportunity \\nbehind doing this trade. Indeed, if you sell two C products for $100 each, and at the same \\ntime buy A and B for $200, this strategy would give the following payout at maturity: \\nAT + BT − 2 × min( AT ,BT ) ≥ 0 \\nwhere AT and BT are the stock prices of A and B at maturity T . Therefore, the payoff of \\nthis strategy is always positive whereas the cost is null. This means you should deﬁnitely \\nsell C for $100. \\n8.3 BEST-OF OPTIONS \\nA best-of option, also known as an option on the maximum, is, as the name suggests, an option \\non whichever among a basket of assets performs the best. \\n8.3.1 Best-of Call \\nPayoff Description  \\nAssume\\n we start  with n assets S1,S2,..., Sn , then a best-of call option for example has payoff \\nat maturity T given by \\nBO Call payoff = max [0,max( S1(T ),S2(T ),..., Sn (T )) − K ] 130 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nTable 8.4 Scenario  observ ations of the underlying’s performances with respect to initial date; note \\nthe difference in payoffs at maturity between the ATM best-of call and the ATM basket call. \\nEuroStoxx S&P 500 Nikkei Best-of call Bask et call \\nScenario 1 3%  −7% 12% 12% 2.67% \\nScenario 2 7%  12% 14% 14% 11.00% \\nScenario 3 − 7% 7% −2% 7% 0.00% \\nSince this option is a call on a best-of, it has a higher payoff potential compared to a call option \\non the same underlying basket, then it is obvious to note that a best-of call is more expensive \\nthan a vanilla basket call (Table 8.4). \\nPricing and Risk Analysis  \\nFirstly, the holder of a  call option has a bullish view on the underlying stocks. \\nThe higher  the  forward price of the individual stocks, the higher will be the forward price \\nof the best performing stock, which will increase the option price. Knowing that interest rates \\nincrease the forward price and that dividends as well as borrow costs decrease the forward \\nprice, we conclude that the best-of call price is an increasing function of interest rates and a \\ndecreasing function of dividends and borrowing costs. \\nAs for the  effects of volatility and correlation: a higher dispersion of the returns will result \\nin a higher potential payoff since the income received by the option’s holder depends on the \\nbest performing stock. In other words, the best-of call price increases if dispersion goes up. A \\nhigher volatility as well as a lower correlation will result in a higher option price. The seller \\nof the option is short dispersion. \\nThe presence  of  skew means lower volatility on the upside, which is where the best-of \\ncall option pays. The market implies a skewed distribution where upside returns have a lower \\nprobability than that implied by a ﬂat volatility. More skew amounts to a lower expected payoff \\nfor the best-of call, so the seller of this option is long skew. \\nExercise Imagine you are\\n  a structurer visiting a client with salespeople from your company. At the \\nend of the marketing presentation, the client is discussing some products that might interest \\nhim. He is interested in buying a 6-month European at-the-money call option based on the \\nbest performing stock between Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. He wants you to give \\nhim an immediate approximate price of this option knowing that you don’t have a pricing \\nmodel in front of you. Assume that the bank sector suffered a violent crash one week ago \\nand you know that the prices of individual 6-month at-the-money European calls on Merrill \\nLynch and Morgan Stanley are 6% and 8% respectively (prices expressed in percentage of \\nthe notional). What would your offer be? Dispersion 131 \\nDiscussion The offer price\\n  in a scenario such as this constitutes what is known as an indicative price, \\none that should be as close as possible to the actual price at which the bank is willing to \\nsell such an option. Keep in mind that a best-of call price is higher than the price of the \\nindividual calls on each underlying stock since its payoff is higher or equal to the payoff of \\nthe call option on the stock that performed the best. Your offer would certainly be higher \\nthan 8%, which is the price of the call option on Morgan Stanley. \\nThinking about  a  best-of call price from a correlation point of view, the higher the \\ncorrelation, the lower the price of a best-of call. Basically, we can now determine the \\nmaximum offer we could suggest to the client. The maximum price of a best-of call occurs \\nwhen correlation between the two underlyings is the lowest. If the correlation ρ =−1, \\nthis means that we expect one of the stocks composing the basket to go up and the other \\nto go down. In this particular case, we can hedge a short position in a best-of call by \\nselling two calls, one on each stock. So, the maximum price of this best-of call is equal to \\n8% +6% =14%. \\nKeeping in mind  that the bank stocks crashed one week ago, both realizing large negative \\nreturns, and, therefore, that realized correlation is quite high, an indicative offer for this \\noption is around 10%–11%, which seems to be a level that is neither too aggressive nor too \\nconservative. \\nOne can ag ain derive a parity relationship between the best-of call and the worst-of call. By \\nnoting that the sum of a best-of call and a worst-of call on the same two assets is equivalent to \\ntwo standard call options on the two assets: \\nBO Call price(K ) +WO Call price(K ) =C(S1,K ,T ) +C(S2,K ,T ) \\nwhatever the position  of S1 and S2 with respect to each other and to the strike K , the left- and \\nright-hand sides of the equation are equivalent. \\n8.3.2 Best-of Put \\nPayoff Description  \\nAssume\\n we start  with n assets S1,S2,..., Sn , then a best-of put option has payoff at maturity \\nT given by : \\nBO Put payoff =max [0,K −max( S1(T ),S2(T ),..., Sn (T ))] \\nwhere K is  a predetermined strike price. \\nSince this option  is a put on a best-of, it has a lower payoff potential compared to a put \\noption on the same underlying basket. This makes the best-of put cheaper than a vanilla basket \\nput (see Table 8.5). \\nPricing and Risk  Analysis \\nA parity  relationship  for the best-of put exists: If BO Put price and BO Call price are respectively \\nthe prices of a European put and a European call option on the best-of two assets S1 and S2, 132 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nTable 8.5 Scenario  observ ations of the underlying’s performances with respect to initial date, note \\nthe difference in payoffs at maturity between the ATM best-of put and the ATM basket put. \\nEuroStoxx S&P 500 Nikkei Best-of put Bask et put \\nScenario 1 − 3% −7% 5% 0% 1.67% \\nScenario 2 2%  4% −14% 0% 2.67% \\nScenario 3 − 7% −13% −2% 2% 7.33% \\nthen again, by a parity relationship, we have: \\nBO Put price(K) = e−rT K − BO Call price(0) + BO Call price(K) \\nThe proof of  this result is similar to that of the parity relationship between worst-of calls and \\nworst-of puts, and is veriﬁed by simply considering the possible outcomes. \\nWith regards to  risks, ﬁrstly, the holder of a put option has a bearish view on the underlying \\nstocks. The higher the forward price of the individual stocks, the higher will be the forward \\nprice of the best performing stock, which will decrease the option price. Knowing that interest \\nrates increase the forward price and that dividends as well as borrow costs decrease the forward \\nprice, we can conclude that the best-of put price is a decreasing function of interest rates and \\nan increasing function of dividends and borrowing costs. Table 8.6 summarizes these positions \\nfor the seller of a best-of call and best-of put. \\nWith respect  to  the Deltas we have an analogous argument to the case of the best-of call. \\nAssume that we sell a best-of put, we will go short Delta of stock on the trade date with the \\nrespective Deltas. Imagine that S1 starts to increase and assumes the role of the best-of, we \\nexpect the Delta on S1 to increase (in absolute value), and at the same time the Delta on S2 \\nto decrease (again in absolute value). Indeed the best-of put starts to be more sensitive to the \\npotentially best performing stock since its payoff is based on its performance. \\nAs for the  effects of volatility and correlation, a higher dispersion of the returns will likely \\nresult in a lower payoff since the income received by the option’s holder depends on the best \\nperforming stock. In other words, the best-of put price decreases if dispersion goes up; a higher \\nvolatility as well as a lower correlation will result in a lower option price. However, the position \\nin volatility is not this obvious in this case where we are talking about a simple best-of put \\noption. If we keep in mind that volatility increases the price of a put option, then the volatility \\nhas two opposite effects on the option price. On the one hand, it is increasing the expected \\npayoff of the call; on the other hand, it increases dispersion which raises the level of the best \\nperforming stock and thus decreases the payoff’s potential. The position in skew is also not \\nclear and cannot be stated generally, but the option will have sensitivity to skew, one way or \\nanother, and a calibration to individual skews is necessary to see this effect when pricing. \\nBecause this is  a multi-asset option, calibrating to a set of European options on each of the \\nunderlyings must be done individually. Any Monte Carlo pricing simulations must be based \\non a correlation matrix that is obtained following the procedures of Chapter 7 and taking into \\naccount the correlation position of the seller of the option. \\n8.3.3 Market Trends in  Best-of Options \\nCalls based  on  the best performing stock are less traded in the market since they are more \\nexpensive, thus less attractive to investors. However, exotic traders can sell calls containing a Dispersion 133 \\nTable 8.6 Individual  parameter positions for a best-of option trader. \\nSeller of a best-of call Seller  of a best-of put \\nInterest rates  Short  Long \\nBorrowing costs Long Short \\nDividends Long Short \\nV olatility Short Depends \\nCorrelation Long Short \\nSkew Long Depends \\nbest-of feature to balance their position with respect to dispersion. Interesting options can be \\nformed that somewhat involve best-of features, for example the Himalaya of Chapter 15 which \\ntakes the best returns each period, locks them into a ﬁnal payout and removes the asset from \\nthe basket moving forward. The Himalaya comes under the class of mountain range options \\nthat each have some aspect of dispersion in their payoffs. Best-of and worst-of options are \\nspecial cases of rainbow options that we will see in the next chapter, in which the weights are \\npreset on the basis of performances, e.g. 80% on the best performing and 20% on the second \\nbest at maturity. When harnessed in a constructive manner in payoffs, dispersion can be a \\npowerful tool. 9 \\nDispersion Options \\nVirtue is more clearly shown in the performance of ﬁne actions than in the non-performance of \\nbase ones. \\nAristotle \\nIn this chapter we take the concept of dispersion in exotic options a step further, and look at \\nsome interesting dispersion-related payoffs: rainbow options , individually capped basket calls \\nand outperformance options. We make the payoff mechanisms clear for each with the use of \\nscenarios, and then move to a discussion of the risks entailed in pricing and trading each of \\nthese options. \\n9.1 RAINBOW OPTIONS \\n9.1.1 Payoff Mechanism \\nThe\\n rainbo w option  pays on a return weighted by the performances of the underlying stocks; \\nthat is, the weights are agreed in the contract, but the actual payoff at maturity depends on how \\nthe assets performed. Discussions of rainbow options exist in the literature, for example the \\noriginal article by Rubinstein (1995). Now, taking the example of the world basket,1 we sell a \\nrainbow call on the basket with weights of 50%, 30% and 20% so that the return at maturity \\nT is given by \\nRet = 50%  × Best return + 30% × Second best + 20% × Third best \\nand the option  is a call on this performance-weighted return. \\nRainbow payoff = max [0, Ret] \\nConsider a speciﬁc  scenario: Assume that an investor buys a 3-year note containing an Asian \\nrainbow option on the S&P 500 index, the Eurostoxx 50 index and the Nikkei index. The note \\nis denominated in dollars and the investor has a notional of $80 million to put in the note. \\nThe rainbow weights are [50%, 30%, 20%].The Asianing return is computed by averaging the \\nreturns of the individual stocks from the note’s initial date. At maturity, the investor receives \\n100% of its capital plus a payoff linked to the rainbow option. Tables 9.1 and 9.2 show a \\nreturns scenario of the underlying assets and the implied payoff mechanism of the rainbow \\noption. After ordering the stocks in decreasing performance, which are respectively the Nikkei \\nindex, the EuroStoxx 50 index and the S&P 500 index, we can now compute the payoff of this \\nrainbow structure: \\nRainbow payoff = (13% × 50%) + (10.33% × 30%) + (9% × 20%) = 11.4% \\n1 The world basket consists of the S&P 500 index, the Eurostoxx 50 index and the Nikkei index. 136 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nTable 9.1 Annual  observ ations of the underlying’s \\nreturns with respect to initial date. \\nEuroStoxx 50 S&P 500 Nikkei \\nReturn year 1 9% 7% 6% \\nReturn year 2 15% 12% 14% \\nReturn year 3 7% 8% 19% \\nAverage return 10.33%  9% 13% \\nAt maturity, the investor receives $89,120,000, which is equivalent to 111.4% of the invested \\ncapital. 9.1.2 Risk Analysis \\nThe holder  of\\n  a rainbow option expects a rising market. Therefore, the payoff is higher if the \\nunderlying returns go up. Higher forward prices increase the rainbow’s price. The seller of \\nthis option would be short the indices’ forwards, and will need to buy Delta in each of the \\nunderlying assets on day 1, and adjust dynamically through the life of the trade to remain \\nDelta neutral. Thus, he would be short interest rates, long dividends and long borrowing costs. \\nIn the e xample described above, the rainbow weights are [50%, 30%, 20%]. In this case, \\nit is hard to know whether the option’s seller is long or short dispersion. The only way to \\ndetermine the trader’s position in volatility and correlation is to compute the option price with \\ndifferent volatility and correlation levels. As such, one can see whether the sensitivities to \\nthese two parameters are positive or negative, and accordingly choose which levels to use in \\nthe pricer. Typically one bid/asks the levels of these two parameters, and the spread depends \\non the underlyings and the current state of the market. The option will show sensitivity to \\nthe implied volatilities of each of the underlyings, and the set of European options with the \\nmaturity of the rainbow can serve as Vega hedging instruments. The skew position is also \\ndependent on the weights accordingly. \\nHowever, this is  not the case for all rainbow options. For example, in the case of a rainbow \\noption having weights with values far from each other, like [70%, 20%, 10%], the option’s \\nbehaviour is similar to a best-of call option, then the trader selling this option would be short \\ndispersion, which means short volatility and long correlation. If the rainbow’s weights are \\ndispersed, the option’s price is higher. A rainbow option paying 80%, 15% and 5% of the best \\nperformances is certainly more expensive than one paying 60%, 30% and 10% of the best \\nperformances (Table 9.3). \\nA rainbow note  is composed of a zero coupon bond which enables the holder to receive \\nhis invested capital back at maturity, as well as a geared rainbow option.

For instance, let’s take a 3-year maturity individually \\ncapped basket call based on a basket of N stocks. At the end of each year i , we observe the \\nindividual returns Ret( i, j ) of the shares j composing the underlying basket: \\nS(i, j  )Ret( i, j  ) = − 1, i = 1,2,3, j = 1,..., N S(0, j  ) \\nThen we cap  each stock return at Cap% (say 20%). The individual capped returns \\nCapped Ret(i, j ) are computed as follows: \\nCapped Ret( i, j  ) = min Ret( i, j ),Cap% \\nThe holder  of  the option receives an annual coupon, Coupon( i ) (ﬂoored at 0%) of value of the \\narithmetic average of the capped returns. \\n⎡ ⎤ \\n1\\n N \\n⎦ Coupon( i )  = max ⎣0, × Capped Ret( i, j )N j=1 \\nObviously, coupons can be paid periodically (monthly, quarterly, annually) or at maturity of \\nthe option, depending on the terms agreed by the contract. \\nTo clarify  this  payoff mechanism, consider the following scenario: A British distributor \\ndecides to buy a 3-year maturity ICBC based on a basket composed of the 10 stocks in \\nTable 9.4. The notional of this option is £30 million. The individual caps are equal to 15% and \\ncoupons are paid annually. Table 9.4 shows the individual observed returns and the process \\nthrough which the coupon values are determined: Note that the maximum annual paid coupon \\nwould be equal to Cap (in this case 15%) since (1/N ) × /summationtextN \\n=1 Capped Ret( i, j ) ≤ Cap. Then, j \\nif the price of an individually capped basket call is higher than Cap, it is worth trying to discover \\nwhat has gone wrong when pricing this option. 138 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nTable 9.4 Scenarios  for the 10 underlying stocks’ annual returns composing the basket of a 3-year \\nICBC.

Higher forward prices increase the call’s \\nprice. The seller of this option would be short the stock’s forwards and will need to buy Delta \\nin each of the underlying assets on day 1, and adjust dynamically through the life of the trade \\nto remain Delta neutral. The seller is short interest rates, long dividends and long borrowing \\ncosts. \\nNow, would a  high dispersion increase the option’s price? The answer is a deﬁnite no. To \\nprice this option, one typically simulates paths using Monte Carlo, and then obtains a price \\nfrom a large sample of paths. For the sake of an example, consider a smaller number of possible \\npaths, as depicted in Figure 9.1. If dispersion is high, this means that volatility is high and \\ncorrelation is low. If we take the case of low-correlated stocks, we get a lot of positive returns \\nand a lot of negative returns. If at the same time, volatility is high, this means that we would \\nget returns far from their expected value, and thus more extreme values.

This means that the downside effect is more important than the upside \\neffect because of caps applied to individual returns. Therefore, the potential payoff is lower \\nwhen dispersion is higher. In other words, the seller of this option is long dispersion; which \\nmeans he would be long volatility and short correlation. \\nIf we think  of an ICBC as a basket of covered calls, then it’s easy to ﬁgure out the skew \\nposition. Since the skew makes covered calls more expensive, it also makes the ICBC option \\nmore expensive. Therefore, the seller of an ICBC is short skew. The lower the number of \\nstocks composing the basket, the lower the downside effect with respect to the upside effect, \\nand consequently, the higher the ICBC price would be (Table 9.5). \\nExercise Imagine you w\\n ork on the sell side and are about to sell an ICBC to a client. You already \\npriced the option and are calling him to communicate your offer price. This client has \\njust changed his mind about the product he wants to invest in and says: “Let’s slightly \\nmodify the payoff mechanism of the ICBC. Instead of averaging the capped returns on the \\nindividual stocks, let’s take the case where we apply a global cap denoted Cap (equal to the \\nICBC cap) on the basket’s return, which is the average of the individual stocks’ returns.” \\nThe option  we  are talking about is called a call on a capped basket and its annual payoff \\nis equal to: \\n1 N \\nCBC payoff = max 0, min Ret i , CapN i=1 \\nDo you think this option is cheaper or more expensive than the ICBC you were about to \\noffer? Moreover, do you believe the risks associated with hedging a capped basket call are \\nsimilar to those associated with the ICBC? \\nDiscussion Firstly, if we\\n  think about the maximum payoffs of both options, they are the same. In the \\nbest scenario, the holder would receive Cap% from the ICBC or from the capped basket \\ncall. Now, let’s have a look at some payoff scenarios depending on the fact that the buyer \\nholds an ICBC or a capped basket call. Through the example illustrated in Table 9.6, the 140 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nTable 9.6 Scenarios  for  a CBC, same as the above ICBC, \\nonly returns here are not capped, just the basket itself is \\ncapped. This demonstrates the higher value of the CBC over \\nthe ICBC for a given set of scenarios. \\nReturns Ret. year 1 Ret.  year 2 Ret.  year 3 \\nBoeing\\n −5% 7% 12% \\nCarrefour 3% 12% 19% \\nElectrabel 13% 8% 10% \\nExxon Mobil −2% −6% 0% \\nGenerali 4% −9% 2% \\nGeneral Motors  16%  22% 35% \\nGillette −8% −17% −21% \\nSony −1% 7% −12% \\nToyota 13% 22% 20% \\nUBS 8% 18% 15% \\nAnnual coupons 4.1% 6.4% 8% \\ncoupons paid by the capped basket call are higher than those paid to the holder of the ICBC. \\nIn fact, this is true in all cases; the price of the ICBC is always cheaper than the price of \\nthe capped basket call because its payoff is lower: \\nICBC payoff < CBC payoff \\nsince \\n/bracketleftBigg \\n1 N /summationdisplay /bracketrightBigg /bracketleftBigg /parenleftBigg \\n1 N /summationdisplay /parenrightBigg/bracketrightBigg \\n0, min (Ret i , Cap) 0, min Ret i , Cap max ≤ max  N N i =1 i =1 \\nSee section B.3 of Appendix B for a demonstration of why this is true. \\nWith this being  true, we have to be aware that the ask price of the basket capped call \\nwill be higher than your ICBC’s previous offer. It could also be much higher in the case of \\na high number of underlying assets as well as a high cap level. \\nRegarding the risks  associated with the capped basket call, the payoff doesn’t seem to be \\nso different, then we can expect to hedge this option in the same way that we are hedging \\nan ICBC. However, this is not the case at all; this is an example through which we are \\ngoing to emphasize the fact that one should be cautious with the Greeks even when option \\npayoffs seem to be similar. \\nThe slight  modiﬁcation  the bank’s client suggested in the exercise has a big effect on \\nthe risks associated with hedging a position in this option. Firstly, regarding the forward \\nsensitivity, in the case of a capped basket call, it is obvious that higher stock forwards imply \\na higher price. Now, the analysis starts to be interesting when we are talking about volatility \\nand correlation impacts on the capped basket call price. Recall the dispersion effect on the \\nICBC: the dispersion was coming from the idea that the downside effect was more important \\nthan the upside effect when simulating paths. Then, the expected individual capped returns /bracketleftBigg /parenleftBigg /parenrightBigg/bracketrightBigg /summationdisplay \\n/bracketleftBigg /parenleftBigg /parenrightBigg/bracketrightBigg /summationdisplay \\n/bracketleftbigg /bracketrightbigg 141 Dispersion Options \\nare lower if dispersion is higher. But in the case of a capped basket call, there are no caps on \\nthe individual returns; the cap is global, and so the individual upside paths of the underlyings \\nare not dampened, and the downside paths do not gain relative importance. Thus there is no \\ndispersion effect on the capped basket call. This is an intuitive way of understanding that a \\ncapped basket call has risks similar to a simple basket call. \\nTake a capped basket call payoff: \\n1 N \\nCBC payoff = max 0, min Ret i , CapN i=1 \\n1 N \\n= min Cap, max 0, Ret iN i=1 \\nwe are just applying a global cap to the payoff of a basket call. Therefore, a higher volatility \\nincreases the capped basket call price since it increases the potential payoff of a basket call. \\nMoreover, a higher correlation increases the volatility of the basket and then increases its \\npayoff. Thus correlation increases the price of a capped basket call. \\nWhen a trader  sells an ICBC, they are buying the volatilities of the underlying assets, and \\nselling the correlations between them. When selling a capped basket call, they are no longer \\ndealing with dispersion, and the risks involved are slightly simpler, but it is still necessary to \\nknow that they are selling the volatilities and correlations. We note that the capped basket call \\nhas Greeks that resemble the call spread, for which we know the Vega can become negative \\ndepending on the paths of the underlying basket and position of the basket forward. \\n9.3 OUTPERFORMANCE OPTIONS \\n9.3.1 Payoff Mechanism \\nThe\\n outperformance  option,  also referred to as a spread option, is typically European style, \\nand has a payoff based on the positive return of an asset S1 over another asset S2. Discussions \\nof outperformance options exist in the literature – for example, Derman (1992), discussing \\noutperformance options, and Margrabe (1978) on the closely related topic of options to \\nexchange one asset for another. At maturity, the outperformance option holder receives a payoff \\ngiven by \\nS1(T ) S2(T )Outperformance payoff = max 0, − S1(0) S2(0) \\nIn other w ords, for an option based on the outperformance of S1 versus S2, the holder will \\nreceive money if the performance of S1 is better than the performance of S2. In this case, S1 is \\nsaid to outperform S2. When the payoff takes the form described above, the outperformance \\noption still makes a positive payout even if both underlying assets decrease in value, as long \\nas S1 has a negative performance lower in absolute value than the negative performance of S2. \\nIdeally, the holder of an outperformance option would rather S1 increase and S2 decrease, and \\nthe payoff would then be higher. \\nLet’s take the  example of Adam Alder, an investor who believes that Mexico, as an emerging \\ncountry, will have a faster economic growth than the USA. He decides to invest in a 3-year 142 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nRelative performances of Mexbol and S&P 500 \\n130% 120% \\n100% \\n90% 80% 70% \\n0 1 2 3 110% Index level since inception \\nMEXBOL S&P 500 \\nFigure 9.2 Relative performances of Mexbol and S&P 500, plotted against time in years. Note the \\noutperformance payoff at the end of year 3. \\nmaturity outperformance option based on the Mexican Bolsa index,2 known as Mexbol, versus \\nthe S&P 500 index. Then, this option Mexbol vs S&P 500 pays Adam Alder a coupon if the \\nMexican index outperforms the American index at the end of the third year. \\nFigure 9.2 sho ws the relative performances of the Mexbol and S&P 500. This is a scenario \\nwhere Mexbol outperforms S&P 500, and this means that the option’s holder will be paid at \\nmaturity. The ﬁnal level of Mexbol is equal to Mexbol(T)/Mexbol(0) = 119.48%, whereas \\nthe ﬁnal level of S&P 500 is equal to S&P 500(T) /S&P 500(0) = 87.27%. The holder of the \\noutperformance option on Mexbol vs S&P 500 will receive a coupon equal to 119.48% − \\n87.27% = 32.21% of the option’s notional. \\n9.3.2 Risk Analysis \\nThe seller  of  this option is essentially short the forward price of S1 and long the forward price \\nof S2. The seller will be long the dividends of S1 because he will have to go long an amount \\n/Delta1S1 in S1 to hedge the risk to this underlying, and short the dividends of S2, again from the \\nDelta hedge, but in this case the hedger of the outperformance will need to go short an amount \\n/Delta1S2 in S2. \\nMoreover, a high  dispersion means having performances potentially far from each other. \\nThe higher the difference between underlyings’ performances, the higher the payoff of this \\noption; so dispersion has an increasing effect on the outperformance option price. The seller \\nof this option is then short dispersion, which means that he is long correlation between the \\nindices and short their volatility. \\n2 The Mexbol is a capitalization-weighted index of the leading stocks traded in the Mexican Stock Exchange. 143 Dispersion Options \\nTable 9.7 Individual  parameter positions for an outperformance option seller. \\nw.r.t. asset S1 w.r.t. asset S2 \\nInterest rates Short Long \\nBorrowing costs Long Short \\nDividends Long Short \\nV olatility Short Short \\nCorrelation Seller  is long the correlation between the two indices \\nAs is the case for best-of options, outperformance options are another way for an exotic trader \\nto balance his global position in dispersion. Selling such options involves selling volatility, but \\nmore importantly, involves buying correlation. This sets it out from the majority of multi-asset \\noptions in which the seller is short correlation. \\nExtending the payof f of the outperformance option, the two assets whose performances \\nare being compared could in fact be baskets of assets B1 and B2 which need not be equally \\nweighted (Table 9.7). The seller of the option will still be long the correlations between the two \\nbaskets, i.e. long the pairwise correlations between any one element of B1 and one element of \\nB2, but will be short the correlations within each basket, i.e. the pairwise correlations between \\nany two elements of B1 or any two elements of B2. The sub-basket correlation positions can \\nbe seen by recalling the formula for the volatility of a basket, it involves the covariances and \\nthus the correlations, and so an increase in the correlations within a basket raises the overall \\nbasket volatility. The seller of the option is short the volatility of each basket and is thus short \\nthese correlations. \\n9.4 VOLATILITY MODELS \\nIn order to capture the skew effects in each of these payoffs, to which all of them are sensitive, \\nwe will need to calibrate a skew model, the simplest being a local volatility model, to each \\nunderlying’s implied volatilities. If the option’s payoff is only a function of the returns of each \\nunderlying at maturity, then it is imperative to get that particular skew correct in the calibration \\nand we would use the exact date-ﬁtting model described in section 4.3.3. European options \\nwith the same maturity as the exotic in question can serve as Vega hedging instruments, but \\nthe model must be calibrated to them in order that it shows risk against them. If there is some \\nform of additional path dependency, such as averaging, then we need to use a form of smooth \\nsurface local volatility calibration described in section 4.3.3 in order to capture the effect of \\nsurface at all dates where the payoff is sensitive. \\nAll these  payof fs are multi-asset and are thus sensitive to the correlations between the \\nvarious underlyings. These correlations must be correctly speciﬁed by the criteria laid out in \\nChapter 7 and by also observing which side of correlation sensitivity the seller of such options \\nis on. For example, in the case of an ICBC, the seller is short correlation and will thus mark \\ncorrelations accordingly before these are used as inputs to run a multi-asset simulation of each \\nof these calibrated models. In outperformance options the position in correlation is reversed, \\nand again correlations must be correctly speciﬁed before simulating the skew model. 10 \\nBarrier Options \\nOne barrier falls and the next one is higher \\nBarrier options are options that have a payoff contingent on crossing a second strike known \\nas the barrier or trigger. The barrier options family includes a large variety of options that \\nare quite popular. They come cheaper compared to traditional options with similar features, \\noffer ﬂexibility in terms of hedging or speculation and higher potential leverage than standard \\nvanilla options. \\nThere are tw o kinds of barrier option: knock-out options and knock-in options. Knock-out \\noptions are options that expire when the underlying’s spot crosses the speciﬁed barrier. Knock-\\nin options are options that only come into existence if the barrier is crossed by the asset’s price. \\nThe observation of the barrier can be at any time during the option’s life (American style) or \\nat maturity only (European style). We note that the monitoring of the barrier must be clearly \\nlaid out in the contractual terms of the option, to avoid any ambiguity or misunderstandings \\nin whether or not a barrier event occurs. \\nFirstly, we present  the payoff mechanism of simple barrier options and some closed formulas \\nto price these options in a ﬂat volatility environment. Barrier options have skew dependency \\nand this must be priced, typically by simulating a skew model. We also discuss the adjustments \\nto be made when monitoring discrete barriers. Some replication arguments are given and we \\ndiscuss the concept of barrier shifts which are important in the context of hedging barrier \\noptions. \\nOnce all these  concepts are well understood, we discuss the details of the risks associated \\nwith the down-and-in put, which is an option that is commonly used to increase the yields \\noffered by structured products. To conclude we present the shark note as well as reverse \\nconvertibles which are examples of funded structured products based on barrier options and \\ndispersion. \\n10.1 BARRIER OPTION PAYOFFS \\n10.1.1 Knock-out Options \\nKnock-out\\n options,  also  referred to as extinguishable , are path-dependent options that are \\nterminated, i.e. knocked out, if a speciﬁed spot’s price reaches a speciﬁed trigger level at any \\ntime between inception and expiry. In this case, the holder of the option gets zero payout. If \\nthe underlying has never breached the barrier during the life of this option, the option holder \\nessentially holds an option with the same features as a European option of the same strike and \\nexpiry. \\nTherefore, the closer  the barrier level is to the initial spot, the cheaper the knock-out option \\nwould be. Moreover, it is interesting to note that a knock-out option is less sensitive to \\nvolatility than a vanilla option carrying the same features. Indeed, a higher volatility increases \\nthe probability of expiring in-the-money but also increases the probability of reaching the 146 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nUnderlying Asset S&P 500 Index \\nNotional $1,000,000 \\nCurrency USD \\nInitial Spot Price 1,400 points \\nStrike Price 1,400 points \\nInitial Date 15/06/2008 \\nMaturity Date 15/06/2009 \\nBarrier (outstrike) 1,820 points \\nBarrier Monitoring daily observations \\nOption Price 1.69% ($16,900) \\nFigure 10.1 The terms of an up-and-out call option. \\nbarrier and ending with no value. The Vega of a knock-out option is generally lower than the \\nVega of a comparable vanilla option. This is an important aspect of the appeal of such options. \\nWhen knock-outs  are  deﬁned with the barrier placed in such a way that the option vanishes \\nwhen it is out-of-the-money, we call these regular knock-out options. In these, it is easier for \\ntraders to hedge the associated risks. Otherwise, knock-out options are classiﬁed as reverse \\nand they present higher trading difﬁculty and risks. \\nAll kinds  of  barrier options are traded in the OTC market, for example the down-and-out \\ncall and the up-and-out put are cheap options that die when they become out-of-the-money \\nbeyond the barrier. For instance, if the market increases a lot, a fund manager holding a \\nprotective up-and-out put would potentially give up his option since he no longer needs to \\nhedge his portfolio of assets at the previous level. This protective barrier option is cheaper \\nthan its European counterpart, the protective put. \\nIn the case  of knock-out options, an additional feature called a rebate can be added to the \\ncontract speciﬁcations. The rebate is a coupon paid to the holder of a knock-out option in case \\nthe barrier is breached. \\nIn the terms  described in Figure 10.1, we are dealing with a 1-year 100 call/KO 130 \\n(pronounced 100 call knock-out 130 in the jargon). This means that the option is at-the-\\nmoney (strike = 100% of the initial spot) and the barrier is at 130% of the initial spot \\n(1,820/1,400 = 130%). From the inception date (15/06/08) until maturity (15/06/09), we \\nmake daily observations on the close price of the underlying asset. If it reaches 1,820 points \\nat the end of any day during the life of the option, this up-and-out call dies and the holder \\nreceives nothing. In the case where the spot price of the S&P 500 has always been below \\n1,820 points, the option’s holder receives the payoff of an at-the-money vanilla call. For \\ninstance, if the spot price is equal to 1,610 on 15/06/09, the holder of this option receives a \\ncoupon of 15% (1,610/1,400 − 1 = 15%), which is equal to $150,000. He would have realized \\na proﬁt of $133,123 (15% − 1.69% = 13.31% of the notional). \\nThe price  of  a 1-year vanilla at-the-money call option (same features) on S&P 500 is equal \\nto 10.2%. In the example described above, the vanilla call option’s holder would have realized \\na proﬁt of $48, 000 (15% − 10.20% = 4.8% of notional). This shows that the leverage effect \\nof the up-and-out call can be much more attractive than the leverage of a comparable vanilla \\ncall for an investor who believes the spot will not reach the outstrike during the investment \\nperiod. He gets more proﬁt for bearing the risk of knocking out. \\nIn this e xample, we consider a rebate equal to 0; the premium of a similar up-and-out call \\nwith a rebate equal to 3% is 2.48%.

This means that the option is at-the-money (strike = 100% of the initial spot) and the \\nbarrier is at 70% of the initial spot (980/1,400 = 70%). From the inception date (15/06/08) \\nuntil maturity (15/06/09), we make daily observations on the close price of the underlying \\nasset. If on the close of any day during the life of the option the underlying is at or below \\n980 points, this down-and-out put dies and the holder receives nothing. In the case the spot \\nprice of the S&P 500 has always been above 980 points, the option’s holder receives the payoff \\nof an at-the-money vanilla put. For instance, if the spot price is equal to 1,120 on 15/06/09, \\nthe holder of this option receives a coupon of 20% (1 − 1,120/1,400 = 20%), which is equal \\nto $200,000. He would have realized a P&L equal to $154,300 (= 20% − 4.57% = 15.43% \\nof notional). \\nThe price  of  a 1-year vanilla at-the-money put option (same features) on S&P 500 is \\nequal to 9.22%. In the example described above, the vanilla put option’s holder would have \\nrealized a P&L equal to $107,800 (= 20% − 9.22% = 10.78% of notional). This shows that \\nthe leverage effect of the down-and-out put can be much more attractive than the leverage of a \\ncomparable vanilla put for an investor who believes the spot will not reach the outstrike during \\nthe investment period. The investor gets more proﬁt for bearing the risk of knocking out. \\nIn this e xample, we consider a rebate equal to 0; the premium of a similar down-and-out \\nput with a rebate equal to 3% is equal to 5.08% (Figure 10.4).

If such a barrier option is activated, the option then becomes \\nessentially European-style and so these options also have lower premiums. If the barrier is \\nnever reached during the life of this option, this means that the option’s holder paid an initial \\npremium for an option that has never come into existence. \\nTherefore, the nearer  the barrier level to the initial spot, the more expensive the knock-in \\noption would be. Moreover, it is interesting to note that a knock-in option is more sensitive to \\nvolatility than a vanilla option carrying the same features. Indeed, a higher volatility can beneﬁt \\nthe holder of the option because it increases not only the probability of maturing in-the-money \\nbut also the probability of reaching the barrier and being activated. The Vega of a knock-in \\noption is then higher than the Vega of a comparable vanilla option. \\nWhen knock-in  options  are deﬁned with the barrier placed in such a way that the options \\nare activated when it is out-of-the-money, then we call them regular knock-in options since it \\nis easier for traders to hedge the associated risks. Otherwise, knock-in options are classiﬁed \\nas reverse and they present greater trading difﬁculties and risks. Regular knock-in options are \\nthe down-and-in calls and the up-and-in puts. The down-and-in puts and the up-and-in calls \\nare reverse knock-in options. \\nKnock-in options  are  not as popular because investors are not really willing to pay a \\npremium for a ﬁnancial asset that doesn’t exist and will perhaps never exist. These are still \\nvirtual options. However, the knock-in options are an efﬁcient investment to have a position \\nin market volatility. \\nIn the terms  described in Figure 10.5, we are dealing with a 1-year 100 put/KI 80. This \\nmeans that the option is at-the-money (strike = 100% of the initial spot) and the barrier is \\nat 80% of the initial spot (4,800/6,000 = 80%). From the inception date (15/06/08) until \\nmaturity (15/06/09), we make daily observations on the close price of the underlying asset. \\nIf it has never reached 4,800 points, the option will not be activated and the option’s holder \\nwould have paid a premium for an asset that never existed. If the spot price of the FTSE \\n100 index reaches 4,800 points at the close of any trading day during the life of the option, \\nthis down-and-in put is activated and the option is equivalent to a vanilla put with the same 149 Barrier Options \\nUnderlying Asset FTSE 100 Index \\nNotional £1,000,000 \\nCurrency GBP \\nInitial Spot Price 6,000 points \\nStrike Price 6,000 points \\nInitial Date 15/06/2008 \\nMaturity Date 15/06/2009 \\nBarrier (instrike) 4,800 points \\nBarrier Monitoring daily observations \\nOption Price 5.84% (£58,400) \\nFigure 10.5 The terms of a down-and-in put. \\nstrike and maturity.

This shows that the leverage effect of the up-and-in call can be much more attractive \\nthan the leverage of a comparable vanilla call for an investor who believes that the spot will \\ncertainly touch the in barrier during the investment period. He gets more proﬁt for bearing the \\nrisk of not knocking in. \\n10.1.3 Summary \\nIn the case  of simple barrier options, there can be eight combinations depending on the option’s \\ncategory (call or put) and the barrier level with respect to the initial spot (up option or down \\noption). Table 10.1 summarizes the description of the eight existing simple barrier options. \\n40% 30% 20% 10% \\n0% \\n90% 100% 110% 120% 130% 140% \\nFigure 10.8 Payoff of an up-and-in ATM call option with knock-in barrier at 120%. 151 Barrier Options \\nT\\nable 10.1 Barrier  options summary table. \\nBarrier Barrier’s effect on the  payoff \\nOption type Situated  Reached Not reached  \\nDown-and-out call Belo w spot  No  value Standard  call \\nDown-and-in call Belo w spot  Standard  call No  value \\nUp-and-out call Abo ve spot No  value Standard  call \\nUp-and-in call Abo ve spot Standard  call No  value \\nDown-and-out put Belo w spot No  value Standard  put \\nDown-and-in put Belo w spot Standard  put No  value \\nUp-and-out put Abo ve spot No  value Standard  put \\nUp-and-in put Abo ve spot  Standard  put No  value \\n10.2 BLACK–SCHOLES V ALU ATION \\n10.2.1 Parity Relationships \\nConsider\\n an in vestor who is long a knock-in option and long a knock-out option with the \\nsame barrier level H , the same strike price K and the same time to expiration T .

If, during the life of the options, the \\nunderlying’s spot has ever reached the trigger, then the knock-out option dies and the knock-in \\noption is activated with the same payoff as a vanilla option with strike K and maturity T .I f \\nthe barrier has never been breached, the knock-in has no value but the knock-out behaves like \\na vanilla option with strike K and time to maturity T . In other words, being long a knock-out \\noption and a knock-in option with the same features is equivalent to owning a comparable \\nvanilla option independently from the behaviour of the spot with respect to the barrier level. \\nHence the following arbitrage relationship: \\nKnock-in( K ,  T , H ) + Knock-out( K , T , H ) = Vanilla( K , T ) \\n10.2.2 Closed Formulas f or Continuously Monitored Barriers \\nIn this section,  we give closed formulas for the different simple barrier options, as well as \\nthe effect of the rebate on the knock-out option valuations.

Therefore, one needs to divide these prices by the initial spot price to get \\na percentage price. 154 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n10.2.3 Adjusting for Discrete  Barriers \\nHere we note  that the closed formulas presented above are for a continuously monitored barrier. \\nMany variations on the barrier theme are available. Usually, barrier levels are monitored at \\ndiscrete ﬁxing times, with barrier observations made periodically. For instance, if barriers are \\nmonitored semi-annually, the seller will check whether the underlying’s spot reaches the barrier \\nlevel on the last trading day of each 6-month period starting from inception until maturity date. \\nBarrier observation frequencies can vary a lot (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, ...) because \\nthese are based on the investor’s preference and traded OTC. \\nIn the case  of knock-out options, the higher the number of barrier observations, the higher the \\nprobability of observing the barrier being breached and the option knocking out. A knock-out \\noption having an annually monitored barrier would be more expensive than a similar knock-out \\noption having a bi-monthly monitored barrier. For knock-in options, this is the opposite. If the \\nnumber of barrier observations increases, the price of the option is more expensive since the \\nprobability of activating it is higher. A knock-in option having a monthly monitored barrier \\nwould be cheaper than a similar knock-in option having a weekly monitored barrier. \\nFor up-and-out  options,  a higher barrier decreases the probability of knocking out and thus \\nincreases the up-and-out option price. The seller of this option is short the barrier since a \\nlower barrier would decrease the price of the sold asset. In the case of down-and-in options, \\na lower barrier level would decrease the probability of knocking in and thus decreases the \\noption price. One buying the down-and-in options would be long the barrier since a higher \\nbarrier will increase the value of his holdings. Table 10.2 summarizes a trader’s position in \\nthe barrier depending on whether he is selling or buying the different combinations of simple \\nbarrier options. \\nBroadie and colleagues  (1997) give a discrete barrier monitoring adjustment formula. If one \\nis short the barrier, he should simply replace the barrier by \\n√ \\n= H e0.5826σ T /mH /prime \\nIf one is long the barrier, he should simply replace the barrier by \\n√ \\nH /prime= H e−0.5826σ T /m \\nHere m is the number of times the asset price is observed (so that T /m is the time interval \\nbetween observations). \\nTable 10.2 Relative positions in the barrier for a barrier option trader \\nSeller of option Buyer of option \\nDown-and-out call Long Short \\nDown-and-in call Short Long \\nUp-and-out call Short  Long \\nUp-and-in call Long  Short \\nDown-and-out put Long Short \\nDown-and-in put Short Long \\nUp-and-out put Short  Long \\nUp-and-in put Long  Short 155 Barrier Options \\nExample Let’s take the\\n  example of Cherif Zidane, a trader selling a 1-year at-the-money call knocking \\nout at 80% for which the barrier is monitored daily. He can price this option using a closed \\nformula for a continuously monitored barrier option and then apply one of the above correction \\nformulas. Firstly, we need to determine whether Cherif is long or short the barrier. The \\n100 call/KO 80 is a down-and-out call. A higher barrier level would increase the probability \\nof knocking out and thus decreases the option price. The trader selling this option is then long \\nthe barrier. Also, let’s assume that the underlying stock implied 1-year volatility is equal to \\n20%. Using the appropriate formula above for the barrier shift, our new barrier is given by \\n√ \\nH /prime= 80% × e−0.5826× 20%× 1/252  = 79.4% \\nNote that in  the above formula T = 1 representing the 1-year maturity, and m = 252 the \\nnumber of observations during the period (there are 252 trading days per year and we want to \\nhave daily observations so m = 252 observations in total). \\n10.3 HEDGING DOWN-AND-IN  PUTS \\nMany structured products use down-and-in puts to obtain enhanced yields or increased par-\\nticipation. The vie w is non-bearish in the sense that one would not expect the puts to knock \\nin and will just receive the high coupon or participation. These products are good examples \\nof structured products not offering capital protection since the buyer of the structure is in fact \\nselling down-and-in puts at maturity and can lose the money invested. The investor accepts the \\nrisk from selling the down-and-in puts to generate extra funding that is used in the structure to \\nincrease the yield or participation. In section 3.10 we discussed this in the context of European \\noptions, and the same concept holds here, only we now have at our disposal barrier options \\nthat allow the downside risk taken to be speciﬁcally tailored to an investor’s risk tolerance. \\n10.3.1 Monitoring the Barrier \\nTraders on the  sell side are usually long the down-and-in put at maturity, and have to hedge the \\nrisks associated with this position accordingly. Firstly, we analyse the effects of the different \\nmarket parameters on the down-and-in put price. \\nIf the forw ard price of the underlying share goes down, then the price of the down-and-in \\nput goes up for two reasons. Firstly, the potential payoff of the put is higher and, secondly, \\nthe probability of activating the option increases. The trader taking a long position in the \\ndown-and-in put is then short the forward, and will need to buy Delta in the underlying asset \\non day 1, and adjust dynamically through the life of the trade to remain Delta neutral. The \\nseller will be short interest rates but is long dividends and long borrowing costs. \\nThe risks  of  a barrier option near the barrier can be difﬁcult to manage. The Delta of a barrier \\noption can jump near the barrier causing hedging problems. When near the barrier, a small \\nmove in the underlying can have a large impact on the price of a barrier option. For example, \\nit could be about to knock out and become worthless. So near the barrier, the Gamma, which \\ngives us the sensitivity of Delta to a movement in the underlying asset’s price, can be very \\nlarge; a small move in the underlying will change the value of Delta signiﬁcantly. One method \\nto smooth out the risks to make them manageable is to apply a barrier shift. 156 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nIf the knock-in barrier is near the initial spot level, this makes the option more expensive \\nbecause the probability of crossing this barrier is higher. For instance, a 100 put/KI 60 is \\ncheaper than a 100 put/KI 70. The trader buying the down-and-in put is then long the barrier \\nsince a higher barrier level increases the option price. Therefore, the trader will apply a shift \\nto the initial barrier when pricing the option in order to compensate for the associated risk. \\nFor instance, if one is about to make a bid on a 100 put/KI 60, he can price this option as if the \\noption was a 100 put/KI 58%; in other words, he can apply a barrier shift equal to 2%, which \\nmakes the option cheaper for the trader since it is less risky. \\nThe shift will  take into account the size of the digital around the barrier and the maximum \\nvolume of underlying share that can be bought or sold during one day. This is referred to as \\na liquidity-based barrier shift, and accounts for the discontinuity in the Delta near the barrier. \\nDepending on the trader’s position with respect to the option, he might need to buy or sell \\na large amount of underlying stock if the barrier is reached. Therefore, the barrier risks are \\nhigher if the digital size is high or the daily traded volume is low. \\nIf he is  long the barrier, he has to apply a barrier shift that lowers the trigger level. The \\nhigher the absolute value of the shift, the cheaper the bid on the down-and-in put would be. \\nIn the case of reverse enquiries, a trader buying an option would win the trade if he gives the \\nhighest bid price, i.e. most aggressive price. At the same time, his bid should represent the cost \\nof his hedge, i.e. being conservative on risks. The balance between these two is ultimately the \\ndifference between the prices seen by an investor from different banks. \\nIn the ﬁrst  days of an option’s life, under normal levels of volatility, the underlying is \\nunlikely to breach the barrier level. If one were to simulate paths and monitor the points in \\ntime at which the barrier was breached, it is obvious that the knock-in events occur more \\nfrequently down the line. One can thus apply a barrier shift that is not constant but is in fact \\nan increasing function of time. \\nLet’s take the  case of an investor willing to sell a 100 call/KI 60 for which the barrier is \\nmonitored daily. He phones three salespeople from different investment banks to get their bid \\nprices by 4 pm. Let’s assume that the three competitors for this trade are willing to charge \\n50 bp as origination P&L and apply the same levels for the parameters affecting the price of \\nthe option (skew, volatility ,...) .A l s o , t h e y a l lw a n t t o apply a maximum shift of 2% to the \\n60% knock-in barrier. However, they have different ways of shifting the barrier. Trader number \\n1 is very conservative and applies a constant barrier shift, as we can see in Figure 10.11. \\nTrader number  2  is less conservative and decides to apply a linear barrier shift as we can \\nalso see in Figure 10.11. At inception date, there is no barrier shift since there is no expected \\nrisk around the barrier. He believes that the maximum shift Shift max to be applied would be \\n2%, which is the shift value at maturity. The barrier shift at time t Shift( t) is computed as \\nfollows \\nt Shift(t ) =  Shift max × T \\nand the barrier level to be applied at time t is then equal to \\nBarrier( t) =  Barrier(0) − Shift(t ) \\nso this shift grows linearly  in  time from zero (inception) to Shift max (at maturity T ). \\nTrader number  3  uses a curvy barrier in time which is computed from evaluating knock-in \\nscenarios. As we can see from Figure 10.11 he is the most aggressive in his barrier shift. \\nTherefore, his bid is the highest and he wins the trade in this case. 157 Barrier Options \\n61% 60% 59% 58% 57% \\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 \\nLinear Shift Fixed Barrier shift Bendy Barrier \\nFigure 10.11 Three barrier shift schemes. The barrier is at 60%, and the three schemes represent the \\neffective shifted barrier used in pricing. \\n10.3.2 Volatility and Down-and-in  Puts \\nThe impact  of  volatility must be considered when hedging the down-and-in put option. A \\nhigher volatility increases not only the probability of knocking in but also the potential payoff \\nof down-and-in puts. The trader buying this option is long volatility. This long Vega position \\ncan be hedged, at least partially, by buying vanilla put options on the same underlying asset \\nwith strikes between the barrier and the spot. \\nWith regards to  the skew effect, as we can see in Figure 10.12, the volatility around the \\nbarrier is higher than the at-the-money volatility, which makes the probability of crossing the \\nbarrier higher. Then the price of the down-and-in put is higher because of the skew. Since \\nthe trader buying this option wants its price to go up, he is then long skew (Table 10.3). When \\nthe trader is long skew, the question is at what level will he be willing to buy skew? This case \\nwe refer to as a skew beneﬁt for the buyer, and it usually ranges from anywhere between 70% \\nand 100%, 70% being a conservative approach in the pricing and 100% being aggressive. \\n60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% \\n0% \\n0% 20% \\n40% 60% 80% 100% 120% 140% \\n1 year Volatility Skew ATM Flat Volatility \\nFigure 10.12 V olatility skew for KI barrier at 60%.

If the barrier is monitored continuously we will need \\nto apply a model that gives a smooth calibration through all ends of the surface between short \\nmaturities and up to the maturity. This means that one must calibrate to both skew and term \\nstructure. The reason is that a continuously monitored barrier option can be triggered at any \\ntime up to maturity, and therefore has Vega sensitivity through the different time-buckets. \\nEuropean options with different maturities must now be calibrated so that the model shows \\nrisk against them. The Vega sensitivity will change as the underlying moves: if a barrier event \\nis close to happening, i.e. the underlying is trading close to the barrier, then the short-term \\nVega will increase and sensitivity to the long-term volatility will decrease. \\nIf the barrier  is only monitored at maturity, then getting the skew corresponding to that \\nmaturity correct is the primary concern and we would use the exact date-ﬁtting model as \\ndescribed in section 4.3.3. For a Vega hedge involving OTM European put options on the same \\nunderlying to be meaningful, they must also have been priced correctly by the model. If such \\ninstruments are not included in the model calibration, the model will not show risk against \\nthem, thus the importance of skew calibration in this case. The cost of hedging the Vega must \\nbe included in the price, and because this option pays on the downside – where we expect to \\nsee high levels of volatility corresponding to the decline in asset price – we must account for \\nthe skew cost. \\n10.3.3 Dispersion Effect  on  Worst-of Down-and-in Puts \\nAs is the  case for single asset structured products using down-and-in puts, many structures \\nbased on multi-assets and dispersion use worst-of down-and-in puts to increase income. Let’s \\ntake a basket of n assets S1, S2,..., Sn . The worst-of down-and-in put has a payoff given by \\nWO DI Put payoff = max 0, K − min (Ret i (T )) × 1{(min i=1,...,n ;t ∈[0,T ] Ret i (t))≤H }i=1,..., n \\nwhere Ret i (t ) = Si (t)/Si (0) − 1 is the return at time t of the i th asset of the basket. The \\nknock-in event can be triggered by any one of the assets. It is the case more often than not, \\ngiven the short maturity, that the underlying to trigger the barrier is the worst performing at \\nmaturity. Nonetheless, if knocked in, the payoff at maturity is that of a put option on the worst \\nperforming asset in the basket, irrespective of which element triggered the knock-in. Also \\nnote that a worst-of down-and-in put is more expensive than a down-and-in put with the same \\nstrike, barrier level and maturity since the potential payoff is much higher. This makes it more 159 Barrier Options \\neffective when used in the context of yield enhancement or for generating income for a higher \\nupside participation, but this obviously involves the investor bearing additional risk. \\nThe risks  here  are essentially the same as those of a single asset down-and-in put, only here \\nwe must account for dispersion. The buyer of the option, typically the sell-side desk, is no \\nlonger buying volatility on one asset, but on several, and is short the correlations between these \\nunderlyings. This is the consequence of the buyer of the worst-of down-and-in put being long \\ndispersion. The individual Vegas can be hedged by turning to the vanilla market and buying \\nOTM puts on the various underlyings, with strikes between the barrier and the spot. The Vega \\nhedging of the single asset down-and-in put described in the previous section holds here, with \\nthe added note that the seller must now trade options on several underlyings to hedge the \\nvolatility sensitivity, and this can lead to additional transaction costs. \\nDepending on the  individual volatilities, the Vegas to each of the underlyings can be different. \\nThe price of the option is sensitive to all the individual volatilities but will be so much more \\nsensitive to the more volatile underlyings owing to the increased probability that they end up \\nas the worst-of. Therefore, the vanilla puts used in the volatility hedges will be of different \\nnotionals. If the barrier is monitored continuously, then the option will have sensitivities in all \\nthe time-buckets, and these vary on the basis of market movements in the underlying assets, \\nmost notably their position relative to the barrier. If the option is knocked in, it thus becomes \\na worst-of put, the risks of which were discussed in section 8.2.2. \\nMoreover, the indi vidual skews increase the option price since, on the one hand, there is a \\ndown-and-in barrier and since, on the other, the payoff is based on the worst performing stock. \\nThen being long a worst-of down-and-in put results in a long skew position on the different \\nassets (Table 10.4). \\nFinally, a higher  barrier level would increase the probability of knocking in, which makes \\nthe price of the option higher. Therefore, if a trader is long a worst-of down-and-in put, he is \\nlong the barrier. \\nThe choice  of  model breaks down to the same case as the single asset down-and-in put. \\nSo again, the choice depends on whether the barrier is monitored throughout the life of the \\noption or just at maturity. If the barrier is monitored continuously we will need to apply a \\nsmooth surface local volatility calibration. If the barrier is only monitored at maturity, then \\ngetting the skew corresponding to that maturity correct is the primary concern and we would \\nuse the exact date-ﬁtting model as described in section 4.3.3. For a Vega hedge involving \\nOTM European put options to be meaningful, they must also have been priced correctly. If the \\nmodel’s calibration does not include such instruments, it will not show risk against them, thus \\nthe importance of skew calibration on each of the individual underlyings. Also, because this \\nTable 10.4 Individual parameter positions for a worst-of down-and-in put trader. \\nWO DI put seller WO DI put buyer \\nInterest rates Long Short \\nBorrowing costs Short Long \\nDividends Short Long \\nV olatility Short Long \\nSkew Short Long \\nCorrelation Long Short \\nBarrier Short Long 160 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nis a multi-asset option we will need to do this for each underlying, and run the simulations \\nbased on a correlation matrix that is obtained following the procedures of Chapter 7 and taking \\ninto account that the seller of this derivative is short correlation.

Consider a 3-year maturity \\nshark based on a basket of n stocks. At the end of each day, we observe the basket’s performance \\nBasket(t ), which is the arithmetic average of the individual performances of the shares j \\ncomposing the underlying basket: \\n1 n /summationdisplay Sj (t )Basket(t ) =  n Sj (0) , t ∈  [0, T ] \\nj =1 \\nand the payoff is given by \\nShark payoff = max [0; Basket( T ) − K ] × 1{(max t ∈[0,T ] Basket(t ))<H }\\n+ R × 1{(max t∈[0,T ] Basket(t ))>H }\\nso, if Bask et(t ) has ever been higher than a predetermined trigger H , 160% for example, the \\nﬁrst part of the equation is zero, and the holder of the shark gets the predeﬁned rebate coupon \\nR at maturity as well as 100% of the notional invested. Otherwise, the second part of the \\nequation is zero, and the holder of the shark note receives 100% of his investment plus a call \\noption payoff on the basket at maturity: \\nmax [0; Bask et(T ) − K ] \\nBarrier observ ations  can be continuous, discrete (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually) \\nor at maturity of the option, depending on the terms agreed in the contract. The name shark \\ncomes from the shark ﬁn like shape of the up-and-out call payoff with rebate upon which this \\nstructure is based. Payoff Mec hanism \\nT\\no elaborate  on  the payoff mechanism, we consider two speciﬁc scenarios. An American \\ninvestor, Kerry Smith, decides to buy a 3-year maturity shark note based on a basket composed \\nof three stocks. The notional of this note is $25 million. Kerry has a bullish view on the \\nunderlying stocks, but believes that the composed basket will not have a spot higher than \\n160% of its initial value during the life of the note. Thus, the outstrike trigger is ﬁxed at 160% \\nand the barrier observations are made daily. \\nFigure 10.13  sho ws a scenario in which the barrier is breached by the basket performance. \\nIn this case, the holder of the shark note receives his capital back at maturity as well as \\na predetermined rebate of 6%. Figure 10.14 emphasizes another scenario which shows the \\nindividual stocks’ performances as well as the basket performance. The barrier has never been 161 Barrier Options \\n190 180 170 160 150 140 130 120 110 100 \\nFigure 10.13 Scenario for the basket performance in a shark note. The barrier of 160% has been \\nbreached by the basket. \\nbreached by the basket although two underlyings have crossed it. Therefore, Kerry Smith \\nreceives a coupon at maturity equal to the return of the basket (51% of notional) plus the 100% \\nof notional from the capital guarantee. This amounts to 151% × $25,000,000 = $37,750,000. \\nRisk Analysis The shark  note\\n  is composed of a zero coupon bond and an up-and-out call option. The zero \\ncoupon bond pays 100% of the notional at maturity and the up-and-out call enables the holder \\nto receive a variable payoff based on the underlying basket performance. The seller of the \\noption’s risk thus comes from the equity part, and we will discuss the risks associated with the \\nup-and-out call. \\nAgain, the holder  of a shark note has a bullish view on the underlying stocks and believes \\nthat the performances of the stocks will not be above a speciﬁc level.

As we can see in Figure \\n10.15, the Delta of the up-and-out call is positive as the spot is below the knock-out barrier. \\nBut as the spot approaches the barrier, the Delta becomes negative.

On the \\none hand, a higher volatility raises the payoff of the call, but at the same time it increases \\nthe probability of hitting the barrier, therefore the position in volatility is a function of not \\nonly where the strike and the barrier are, but also of the time to maturity.

Higher correlation means a higher overall volatility for the basket \\nand the analysis of the position in correlation is the same as that in volatility. \\nThe skew position  is also somewhat awkward. The seller is short the ATM volatility, but \\nlong volatility near the barrier. The magnitude of the volatility sensitivity near the barrier is a \\nfunction of the size of the rebate and the location of the barrier. Thus the overall position in \\nskew is not immediately clear and needs to be checked by increasing skew and computing the \\nsensitivity. \\nAgain, the choice  of model to use in order to capture the skew is based on the barrier \\nmonitoring. In the case described here, we have continuous monitoring of the barrier and \\nwe thus need to apply a smooth surface local volatility calibration in order to capture the \\nskew throughout correctly, for each underlying. The Vega is hedged with options on the \\nindividual underlyings, and any possible hedging instruments must be correctly priced within \\nthe calibration so that the pricing model shows risk against them. Because this is a multi-\\nasset option we will need to do this for each underlying, and run the simulations based on \\na correlation matrix that is obtained following the procedures of Chapter 7 and taking into \\naccount the seller’s position in correlation. \\n10.4.2 Single Asset  Re verse Convertible \\nPayoff Description  \\nAs\\n far as  yield enhancement products go, the reverse convertible is an extremely popular \\nproduct; it pays a ﬁxed coupon at maturity, contingent on an equity event. Many variations \\nexist, but the main one is the combination of a zero coupon bond and a down-and-in put which \\nthe buyer of the reverse convertible is short. In all cases the holder of the reverse convertible \\nreceives the predeﬁned coupon. However, in the event of a knock-in, the holder receives at \\nmaturity the performance of the stock also. This holds downside risk as the performance of \\nthe stock could potentially be large and negative and wipe out both the coupon and part of \\n(or possibly all of) the capital invested, thus the reverse convertible is not a capital protected \\nstructure. The key idea being that the investor is willing to accept some downside risk in \\nexchange for an above market coupon; i.e. yield enhancement. The reverse convertible is a \\ngood product for the investor who is moderately bullish, as the highly bullish investor can ﬁnd \\na better structure to ﬁt his view. The bearish investor should for obvious reasons steer clear. \\nHere the do wn-and-in put is monitored continuously but pays on the return at maturity, \\nthus, as we will see in the scenarios, it is possible that a stock can trigger the barrier, but then \\nrecover and end above the strike, rendering the put worthless. Typical knock-in levels are 70% \\nor 80% depending on maturity, although these products generally have short maturities. \\nPayoff Mec hanism \\nLet’\\ns consider  a  set of scenarios. In this example let’s set the KI barrier at 80% for a 1-year \\nmaturity. Assume interest rates are 4%, the down-and-in put on a speciﬁc stock is worth 6.5%, \\nand let’s assume that the seller wants to take 50 bp of P&L. Then the coupon the seller can \\noffer the investor is given by \\nInterest from  ZCB  + Put Price − P&L = 4% + 6.5% − 0.50% = 10% 164 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n120% 100% \\n90% 80% 70% 60% 50% \\nScenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 110% \\nFigure 10.17 Reverse convertible scenarios. \\nThese come from, ﬁrstly, the zero coupon bond we buy with the notional amount, plus the \\ndown-and-in put (bid) which we have priced, yielding the total amount we have for the coupon. \\nSubtracting out P&L we get the offered coupon. In Figure 10.17 we see the scenarios for a \\nreverse convertible, and the results are given in Table 10.5. \\n10.4.3 Worst-of Reverse Con v ertible \\nThe worst-of v ersion is similar to the reverse convertible just discussed in section 10.4.2, only \\nhere the equity exposure is on a basket of stocks (or indices) instead of just one. Instead of \\nhaving a down-and-in put we have a worst-of down-and-in put. That is, the worst-of reverse \\nconvertible will bear coupons of enhanced yield provided NONE of the underlyings goes \\nbelow the prespeciﬁed knock-in level H . \\nIn the e vent of a knock-in, the investor pays at maturity the negative performance (if any) of \\nthe worst performing stock. Again these will generally be short dated, and we should note that \\nbecause of the worst-of put this, too, is not a capital guaranteed structure. As with the case of \\nthe regular reverse convertible, this product would be good for the investor who is moderately \\nbullish, as the highly bullish can ﬁnd a better structure to ﬁt his view. \\nIt is also  the case, as seen in Table 10.6, that a stock, as in the reverse convertible, can trigger \\nthe barrier, but then all the stocks recover somewhat and the worst ends above the strike, \\nTable 10.5 Scenarios for a reverse convertible paying a coupon of 10% at maturity. Note that in the \\nthird case, the investor has received back less than the 100% invested. This table’s results are \\nassociated with the returns scenarios drawn in Figure 10.17. \\nLowest return KI event KI put payoff RevCon payoff  \\nScenario 1 81%  No 0% 110% \\nScenario 2 72%  Yes 8% 102% \\nScenario 3 52%  Yes 45% 65% 165 Barrier Options \\nT\\nable 10.6 Worst-of  reverse convertible scenarios. A knock-in event happens when one of the \\nunderlying indices composing the world basket has ever crossed the 70% barrier. The returns here \\ncorrespond to the ﬁnal levels of the indices at maturity and the bold column shows the payoff of a \\nworst-of reverse convertible struck at 100% and paying a coupon of 15%. Note that the capital is not \\nguaranteed, as shown in scenario 4. \\nKI event EuroStoxx 50 S&P 500 Nikkei WO-ReCon \\nScenario 1 No  85% 102% 72% 115% \\nScenario 2 Y es 104% 120% 109% 115% \\nScenario 3 Y es 87% 95% 88% 102% \\nScenario 4 Y es 85% 45% 75% 60% \\nrendering the put worthless. The presence of dispersion due to the worst-of feature should \\nmake this put more valuable than a down-and-in put on just one of the underlyings, all else \\nbeing the same. Thus, with added value to the put, equity exposure is greater, ceteris paribus, \\nwhich implies a higher coupon offered in the structure. \\nIn the conte xt of the 2008/09 ﬁnancial crisis, many investors in reverse convertibles lost \\nmoney as a large amount of the put options embedded in reverse convertibles knocked in. \\nThe result was that unaware investors took hold of the underlying stocks and the losses on \\nthese have proved to be substantial. In the secondary market for these products, the note \\npart of some of these structures was also hit owing to the problems involving the issuers, \\nmaking valuations even lower. Banking stocks were among the favourite underlyings for \\nsingle and multi-asset reverse convertibles, primarily because the relatively high volatilities of \\nthe individual underlyings allowed for enticing coupons. These banking stocks were perceived \\nby many investors to be safer than they in fact were. On the other hand, the result of taking \\nhold of the stock in the reverse convertible is no more risky than holding the said stock. /braceleftbigg 11 \\nDigitals \\nThere are 10 kinds of people in the world, those that understand binary and those that don’t. \\nDigital options, also called binary options, pay a speciﬁc coupon when a barrier or trigger \\nevent occurs. There are two kinds of digitals: cash-or-nothing options and asset-or-nothing \\noptions. In this chapter we look at the European and American digitals on single and multiple \\nunderlyings, give examples throughout, and a detailed analysis of the risks involved in these \\ntypes of trades. \\n11.1 EUROPEAN DIGITALS  \\n11.1.1 Digital Payoffs and Pricing  \\nThe European  cash-or -nothing call is an option paying a ﬁxed coupon C if the spot of the \\nunderlying at maturity T is higher than the predetermined barrier level H . The payoff is \\nCash or Nothing payoff = C × 1{S(T )>H } \\nor equivalently \\nCash or Nothing payoff = C if S(T  ) > H \\n0 otherwise  \\nUnder\\n Black–Scholes,  the  price of such an option is given by the following formula: \\nCash or Nothing price = C × N (d2) × e−rT \\nwhere N (d2)i st h e s a m e N (d2) we saw in the Black–Scholes formula for vanilla options in \\nsection 3.5. In fact, N (d2) is the probability that the spot at time T is higher than the trigger. \\nThat is, the derivative of the call price with respect to K is the price of the digital. In much \\nthe same way we saw in Black–Scholes that the Delta sensitivity to underlying S is given \\nby N (d1); in the case of the digital the price is given by N (d2) which is the negative of the \\nderivative with respect to the strike. This is discussed in section 11.1.2; see also section B.4 \\nof Appendix B for derivations. (See Figure 11.1.) \\nNotice the shape  of the price across spot in Figure 11.2 and how it resembles the Delta of a \\nEuropean call option. This is because Delta is N (d1) which is also a cumulative distribution \\nfunction. \\nThe European  asset-or -nothing call is an option that pays the value of the underlying asset \\nat maturity if this value is higher than the digital trigger. \\nAsset or Nothing payoff = S(T ) × 1{S(T )>H } \\nHaving a long position in a European asset-or-nothing call, and being short a European cash-\\nor-nothing call for which the coupon is equal to the barrier level, is equivalent to a long position 168 Exotic Options and Hybrids Option price 10% \\n8% 6% 4% 2% 0% \\n85% 90% 95% 100% 105% 110% 115% 120% \\nFigure 11.1 The payoff of a 10% digital call option struck at 100%. \\nin a vanilla call for which strike price is equal to digital trigger.

Cash-or-nothing digitals are used more often because they allow holders to receive ﬁxed \\ncoupons conditionally on the spot price of a speciﬁc underlying crossing a predetermined \\nlevel. From now on, when discussing digitals, unless stated otherwise, this will implicitly refer \\nto cash-or-nothing digital options. \\n10% \\n5% 0% 130%120%110%100%\\n90%80%70% Spot price \\n1 year maturity 6 months maturity 1 month maturity \\nFigure 11.2 The price of a digital struck at 100% for three maturities, plotted as a function of spot \\nprice.

Notice how the closer the call \\nspread strikes are to the digital strike, the closer the payoff. \\n11.1.2 Replicating a European Digital \\nThe digital  can  be thought of as a limit of a call spread. That is, consider a call spread with \\nstrikes K −/epsilon1 and K +/epsilon1, and a digital struck at K , Digital( K ) paying a coupon of C%. In the \\nlimit we recognize the mathematical derivative \\n1 ∂Call( K )Digital( K )  =lim (Call( K −/epsilon1) −Call( K +/epsilon1)) =− \\n/epsilon1→02/epsilon1 ∂ K \\nT\\no explain this  intuitively, in Figure 11.3 we have a 10% digital and three call spreads. Note \\nthat to obtain the payoffs in the diagram we need one 95–105%, but we need two of the \\n97.5–102.5% call spreads and four of the 98.75–101.25% call spreads. This is a demonstration \\nof the above limit in the sense that, as the distance between the call option strikes and the \\ndigital strikes, /epsilon1, gets smaller, we need 1//epsilon1 call spreads of width 2/epsilon1 to replicate the digital. In \\nthe limit, meaning as /epsilon1 approaches zero, the call spread replicates the digital exactly. To see \\nthis in our example, the digital size is 10%, so we only need one 10% wide call spread (the \\n95–105%) to replicate it. Now assume that we split the width of the call spread in two, we \\nneed two of the 97.5–102.5% call spreads, and so on. \\n11.1.3 Hedging a Digital \\nIn practice,  one  can price and hedge a digital as a call spread, the question is which call \\nspread? The gearing of the call spread required to super replicate the digital depends on how \\nwide we chose the strikes. The term super replicate comes from the fact that the call spread \\nover-replicates the digital. In Figure 11.5, the digital at H has zero payoff before H , whereas \\nthe call spread has the same payoff of the digital after H , but also has a non-zero payoff before \\nH given by the triangle ACH. The smaller the call spread the less the super replication and \\nthus the more aggressive the price. On the other hand, the smaller the call spread the more \\ndifﬁcult the hedging. \\nFor a digital  option, Gamma can be quite large near the barrier, and using a call spread \\nmeans that we obtain less extreme Greeks. The smaller the call spread the larger Gamma, and \\nVega can get near the barrier. At the barrier they both shoot up and then shoot down while 170 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n0.50% 0.40% 0.30% 0.20% 0.10% 0.00% \\n25% 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175%−0.10%0% \\n−0.20% −0.30% \\n−\\n0.40% \\n−0.50% \\nFigure 11.4 The Gamma of a call spread. \\nchanging sign. See Figure 11.4 for the Gamma of a call spread; it, too, changes sign, but is \\nbetter behaved than that of a digital. Since the plan is to Delta hedge this call spread, we need \\nto make sure that as the underlying approaches the barrier we can still manage to Delta hedge. \\nA large Gamma means that Delta is very sensitive to a movement in the underlying, and if we \\napproach the barrier and our call spread is too tight, then we will need to buy a large Delta \\nof the underlying, which might be difﬁcult in the market. To this end it makes sense that we \\nselect the width of our replicating call spreads based on the liquidity of the underlying. \\nIt is possible  to reach a middle ground by which we minimize the price of the option by \\nselecting a small enough call spread but also such that the digital can be hedged without \\nproblems to do with liquidity. Deﬁne MaxDelta as the maximum amount (in the correct \\ncurrency) that one can trade of the underlying, given data of the daily traded volumes, liquidity \\nthat is. Barrier Shifts The barrier  shift\\n  is an amount by which the seller of a digital shifts the barrier, while pricing, so \\nthat in fact they are really pricing a new digital whose replicating call spread is the hedge of the \\nactual digital. The barrier shift will be chosen so that the resulting shifted payoff over-replicates \\nthe payoff of the digital by the least amount, but such that the Greeks of the new payoff are \\nmanageable near the barrier. We note that, although discussed in this section, barrier shifts \\napply not only to European digitals but even more so to American digitals and, furthermore, \\nto conditional digitals such as those in autocallable products in Chapter 12. In this section we \\nfocus on liquidity-based shifts, while it is possible to do other types of meaningful shifts. \\nIn Figure  11.5,  we have a digital of 10% struck at 100%, and we want to specify a call spread \\nto replicate it. The 90–100% call spread does the job, but is in fact an extremely conservative \\ncall spread. If we were to assume a new barrier of H /prime=95%, then the 90–100% call spread \\nis an approximation of the digital with such a barrier. So instead of pricing a call spread, we \\nsimply price a digital with the new barrier deﬁned as the old one minus a shift where \\n1Barrier Shift =2 Width of Call Spread Digitals 171 \\n10% \\n8% 6% 4% 2% 0% \\n85% 90% 95% 100% 105% A H′ C \\nH \\n10% Digital 90%–100% Call Spread \\nFigure 11.5 Here we have a 10% digital, and a 90–100% call spread. The barrier is shifted from H to \\nH /prime, so that the new digital with barrier H /prime is replicated by the 90–100% call spread. \\nIn fact here we have used one call spread, and in virtue of the fact that the payoff of the \\ncall spread forms the triangle AHC we see in Figure 11.5 for which the sides AH and HC are \\nequal. So the call spread width is the same as the size of the digital, i.e. 10%. \\nWe can do  better than this by ﬁnding the call spread with the criteria speciﬁed above, and \\nwe ﬁnd that the optimal call spread, given MaxDelta, we can trade and to minimize the PV , is \\ngiven by the call spread around the shifted barrier where \\n1 Digital  Size  × Notional Barrier Shift =  2 MaxDelta \\nWe multiply  by  the notional to obtain in the numerator the size of the digital in the option \\ncurrency, and divide by MaxDelta to obtain the barrier shift with the required properties. That \\nis, if we centre a call spread around the shifted barrier (new barrier = old barrier + shift) \\nwe know that we can still Delta hedge the call spread, but at the same time this gives us the \\nsmallest call spread (i.e. smallest PV of option) possible from the set of all call spreads. A \\nsmaller shift will mean that we might exceed the MaxDelta, and a larger shift will mean we \\nhave increased the option price above the necessary amount. Using this formula we know that \\nthe gearing on the replicating call spread is given by Digital Size/Barrier Shift, and by using \\nthis shift we have over-replicated the digital by the call spread that can still be hedged. \\nIn practice  some  traders prefer to just take a constant shift of the barrier, and this is again \\nessentially just an additional margin charged for managing the risks if the spot were to approach \\nthe barrier. This can also be the more efﬁcient method to use when risk managing a large book. \\nWe note here  that the direction one should shift the barrier depends on whether one is short \\nor long the barrier. Take the example of the 10% digital and let it be stuck at 110%. If we \\nraise the barrier further, the option becomes cheaper as the probability of reaching the barrier \\nis lower. The seller is therefore long the barrier and in this case we apply a negative shift to \\nbring the barrier down. \\nAlso, let’s note  the case of a down-and-in digital, meaning that the digital strike is below \\nthe current spot and the digital pays the ﬁxed coupon C; if the underlying is below the barrier \\nat maturity, we will be replicating this digital with a put spread (recall the put spread from 172 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nChapter 6 on option strategies). The same concepts of barrier shifts apply to the size and \\nnumber of put spreads one needs to hedge the digital. In this case the seller is short the barrier. \\nThe higher the barrier, the higher the probability of a knock-in and thus the higher the price, so \\nthe seller of the option is short the barrier, and he thus shifts the barrier to the right (a positive \\nbarrier shift) to make it more expensive. \\nAnother example of  being short the barrier is, for example, the no-touch digital, which we \\nwill discuss later. To brieﬂy explain, the no-touch pays the coupon as long as a certain level \\nhas NOT been breached. For example, the 120% strike no-touch digital at maturity pays the \\ncoupon C if the underlying is not above 120% at maturity. A higher barrier raises the price, \\ntherefore the seller is short the barrier and applies a shift to the right to get a higher barrier. \\n11.2 AMERICAN DIGITALS \\nAmerican digitals are like European digitals except for the fact that the trigger event is not \\nmonitored just at maturity but at any time up to maturity. Typically contracts would specify \\na monitoring of the trigger on the daily closing prices. It is then much harder to price such \\noptions since we don’t know when they are going to be exercised. Coupons could be paid if \\nand when such an event occurs, or at maturity of the contract even if the trigger event had \\nalready happened. \\nReﬂection Principle  \\nThe\\n reﬂection  principle  (Figure 11.6) gives us an approximate link between the price of a \\nEuropean digital and an American digital with the same maturity and strike. Let’s assume that \\nthe log-returns of the underlying are normally distributed, but with mean zero. The symmetry \\nthat this introduces (from the symmetric nature of the Normal distribution) in the paths of the \\nunderlying means that the paths where the barrier is hit and reﬂected has the same probability \\nas the path that crosses through the barrier. This implies that the probability of hitting the \\nbarrier is exactly twice the probability of ending up above the barrier at expiry (Gatheral, \\n108% 106% 104% 102% 100% \\n98% \\n0.00 0.20 0.40 0.60 0.80 1.00 \\nSeries 2 Series 1 \\nFigure 11.6 An example of a reﬂected path to illustrate the reﬂection principle. Barrier is at 105%. Digitals 173 \\n2006). The latter of these two gives us the price of the European digital of the same maturity, \\nand we deduce that the value of the American digital is twice that of the European equivalent. \\nNote that in the example here, the European digital is a digital call and the American digital \\npays if the barrier is ever hit during the life of the contract. \\nExercise Imagine that you\\n  are a structurer visiting a client in Kazakhstan who wants to invest in the \\nlocal market. He believes a Kazakhstan oil company called KOS is going to perform quite \\nwell in the coming years. The client wants to buy from you a digital call option that pays \\n$100 whenever KOS stock price reaches $1. KOS actual spot price is equal to $0.7. You \\ndon’t have a pricer in front of you and you need to give the client an offer price for this \\noption straight away. At what price would you sell it? \\nDiscussion First of all,\\n  you have to take into account the features of the Kazakhstan market. It is a \\nvolatile ﬁnancial market because of the lack of liquidity. Moreover, the real problem in \\npricing this option comes from the fact that there is no speciﬁed maturity. This option \\npays a coupon whenever the stock price reaches a speciﬁed trigger. So it is impossible to \\ncompute the probability of striking and then just discounting it. \\nNow remember ,  the price of an option is the cost of hedging it. This American digital \\noption is equivalent to 100 American digital options paying a coupon of $1 if KOS spot \\nreaches $1. If the trader selling these options wants to perfectly hedge them, he just needs \\nto buy 1 KOS share for each individual option, so that if the spot reaches $1, he can just \\nsell 1 KOS stock for $1 and pays the coupon to the client. In order to perfectly hedge the \\ninitial option paying $100 coupon, the trader should buy 100 KOS shares. Then an upper \\nbound price for this option is 100 × $0.7 = $70. \\nIn this case,  there is no easy way to compute a fair value for this option, but we know that \\nyou should sell it for less than $70. So the offer price will depend on the relationship you \\nhave with your client as well as how conﬁdent you feel trading on the Kazakhstan market. \\nUpper Bound  Price  for American Digitals \\nAssume that you  need to give an upper limit to an American digital option paying a coupon C \\nif the spot of an underlying stock reaches K . This option is equivalent to C/K options paying \\na coupon equal to K if the spot reaches K . The trader selling this option needs to buy C/K \\nunderlying shares to be completely hedged. Let S(0) denote the initial spot price; the cost of \\nthe hedge is then equal to C/K × S(0). The fair price of this option should then be lower or \\nequal to C/K × S(0). \\nOne-Touch vs No-Touch \\nThe no-touc h  digital pays a coupon if a speciﬁed barrier is NOT touched throughout an \\nobservation period – that is, the underlying stays within a speciﬁed range. This is different to \\nthe American digitals we saw previously that pay if a barrier has ever been touched, or that 174 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nis the barrier needs to be touched only once (thus the one-touch name). For example, one can \\nhave a 1-year maturity no-touch digital that pays an 8% coupon if the underlying never goes \\nbelow 90%. \\nWhat is neat  about the no-touch is its relationship to the standard American digital, a parity \\nrelationship given by \\nProb(No Touch) +  Prob(One Touch) = 1 \\nwhich makes sense  because if we ﬁx a barrier and look at any path of the underlying, there can \\nonly be two possible outcomes: either the barrier is touched or it isn’t, and these two events \\nare complements. Using this parity one can deduce the price of one from the other (note that \\nin the relationship above these are probabilities not prices), by quite simply multiplying both \\nsides by the required coupon and discounting correctly. In section 11.5.1 below we discuss \\na structure called the wedding cake, which is a series of double-no-touch digitals. The term \\ndouble only means that there are two barriers (an upper and a lower). \\n11.3 RISK ANALYSIS \\n11.3.1 Single Asset Digitals \\nIf the forw ard price of the underlying increases, then the price of the digital goes up since there \\nis a higher probability of the digital call option striking. These digitals have positive Delta, \\nand the seller of the option will have to buy Delta of the underlying, meaning that the seller \\nwill be long dividends, short interest rates, and long borrow costs of the underlying. \\nIf the underlying’ s forward price is lower than the barrier level, the Vega of a digital call is \\npositive. This means that a higher volatility will increase the probability of the trigger being \\nreached, and thus increase the digital price. If the underlying’s forward price is higher than \\nthe barrier level, the Vega of a digital will be negative since a higher volatility increases the \\nprobability of going out-of-the-money. In Appendix B, section B.4, we derive a simple closed \\nform approximation, in the spirit of the approximations of section 5.9 regarding those for \\nBlack–Scholes prices and Greeks, for the Vega position of a digital. \\nTime to maturity  has the same effect on a digital option’s fair value as volatility. A trader \\nselling a digital has a long position in volatility, and is also long time to maturity. In this case, \\nthis means that digitals with higher maturity are cheaper than digitals with lower maturity. \\nNote that time also has a second effect as we must discount it when pricing, although the effect \\nhere is generally larger. \\nThe lower the  barrier, the higher the probability of the coupon being paid. In other words, \\na higher barrier level decreases the digital price. When a structurer prices a digital, he needs \\nto take into account the discontinuity risk around the barrier; therefore the structurer applies a \\nbarrier shift whose effect lowers the initial barrier level if selling the digital. \\nSkew risk is  a critical consideration for the seller of a digital. When hedging a short position \\nin a digital, the trader takes an opposite position in a call spread. As discussed in Chapter \\n6, skew makes a call spread more expensive, and the cost of hedging is then higher. Always \\nremember that the price of an option represents the cost of hedging it; therefore, the skew \\nmakes the price of digitals more expensive. \\nIf we consider  the digital as a call spread, we can immediately see what is happening. \\nThe seller of a call spread is selling volatility at the lower strike call and buying volatility at \\nthe higher strike call. In the presence of skew, the volatility the seller is selling is higher and Digitals 175 \\nthe volatility being bought is lower than in the case of ﬂat volatility. This implies that pricing a \\ndigital without skew means that one has not charged correctly for the volatility being sold and \\npaid too much for the volatility being bought. The seller of the digital is clearly selling skew. \\nOne can e ven write down the price of a digital, using the limit deﬁned in section 11.1.2, \\nand combine it with a parameterization of the skew. That is, the skew, for a given maturity, is \\nthe set of implied volatilities of vanillas across strikes, call it σ(K ) to represent the implied \\nvolatility σ at strike K . Then the price of the digital is given by \\n∂ Call( K )Digital( K )  =− ∂K \\n∂\\n Call( K )  ∂σ(K )  =N ( d2) − × ∂σ ∂K \\n=\\n N (d2) + V ega ×Skew (11.1) /bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright /bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright \\nBlack −Scholes Skew correction \\nwhere Skew is the absolute value of the derivative ∂σ(K )/∂K . Thus, in the case of skew, \\nwe have the correction term to the Black–Scholes price given by Vega ×Skew, which makes \\nperfect sense as this says that, should there be a skew, the additional effect is the steepness of \\nsuch skew times the Vega of a call (think of the digital as a call spread). The above derivation \\nis nothing more than computing a derivative w.r.t. K and noting that the call option’s price \\nnow depends on K directly as it is the strike, but also that σ is now a function of K . \\nBeware the Teeny \\nWhen pricing  a  digital, given that one has a ﬁxed amount to spend, it is sometimes the case \\nthat the model implies a small probability of the digital paying, the result being that the digital \\ncoupon offered may be huge. One must be careful when offering a large digital with a low \\nprobability (Table 11.1). \\nTable 11.1 Individual parameter positions for a digital option trader. \\nDigital call seller  Digital  call buyer \\nInterest rates Short Long \\nBorrowing costs Long Short \\nDividends Long Short \\nV olatility Depends Depends \\nSkew Short Long \\nBarrier Long Short \\nExercise Consider two European\\n  digitals A and B on the same underlying stock. The options pay \\nthe same coupon if the underlying’s spot reaches a trigger equal to 160%. Option A expires \\nin 1 year; the other option expires in 3 years. Which one is cheaper and why? /braceleftbigg 176 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nDiscussion For issues  concerning\\n  Theta, it is always more convenient to think about it in terms of \\nvolatility ﬁrst. Since the trigger level is at 160%, this means both options A and B are \\ndeep out-of-the-money. Then volatility increases the price of the digital options. Time to \\nmaturity having the same effect on digital prices as volatility, we can say that option B is \\nmore expensive than option A. \\n11.3.2 Digital Options with  Dispersion \\nAgain given n  assets S1,S2,..., Sn , and a maturity T , the worst-of digital with coupon C and \\nstrike H pays, as the name implies: \\nWorst-of Digitalpayoff = C if min Si (T ) > H , for i = 1t o n \\n0 otherwise \\nwhere the minimum  over the terminal asset prices is obviously the worst-of. Worst-of digitals \\nare quite popular in the world of structured products. An exotic trader of single asset digitals \\nis usually selling worst-of digitals; therefore, it is important to get used to the different risks \\ninvolved in trading these products in order to hedge them properly (see Table 11.2). \\nWith respect  to  forward price sensitivity, we can start by thinking about it in the same way \\nthat we did for digitals on single assets, combining this with what we learned about worst-of \\noptions in Chapter 8 on dispersion. In fact, higher interest rates, lower dividends and borrow \\ncosts will increase the forward prices of the different underlying shares. These will increase \\nthe forward price of the worst performing stock and thus make the option more expensive. \\nFor the Vega of  a worst-of digital, things get more interesting. As we saw in the discussion \\nof worst-of calls in Chapter 8, the Vega position is not standard for every case. Recall that \\nthe seller of a worst-of call is short volatility because of the call option feature, but is buying \\nvolatility because it is long dispersion, and the overall position for the worst-of call was a \\nfunction of the levels of volatility, correlation and the forwards, and can be either long or short \\nin volatility. If we think about a worst-of digital as a worst-of call spread, the ﬁrst thing to \\nnote is that the Vega of a call spread is less than that of just a call, and, again, since we are \\nlong dispersion and thus long volatility because of the worst-of feature, overall we expect the \\nseller of the the worst-of digital to be long volatility. In this case, the Vega effect from the call \\nTable 11.2 Individual parameter positions for a \\nworst-of digital trader. \\nWO digital  seller  WO digital buyer \\nInterest rates Borro wing \\n costs \\nDividends V olatility Skew Correlation Barrier Short \\nLong  \\nLong\\n \\nLong \\nShort Short \\nLong Long \\nShort  \\nShort\\n \\nShort \\nLong Long \\nShort Digitals 177 \\nspread is minimal compared to the effect of dispersion on the volatility position, unlike the \\ncase of the worst-of call where the Vega from the call option feature can be more signiﬁcant. \\nSince this is  a worst-of style multi-asset product, a higher dispersion decreases the price of \\nthe worst-of digital and our correlation exposure comes from this dispersion effect. The seller \\nof the worst-of digital is short correlation. As for the skew, we previously saw the skew effect \\non single asset digitals as well as the skew effect on worst-of products. In the case of worst-of \\ndigitals, skew generally makes their price more expensive. \\nConcerning the trigger  effect, it is obvious that a lower trigger level increases the price of the \\nworst-of digitals. When selling these options, a structurer will apply barrier shifts, lowering \\nthe trigger level. \\nNote that the  assets composing the underlying basket can have quite different average traded \\nvolumes. Recall that the size of the barrier shift (in fact the whole motivation behind it) is \\nbased on the liquidity of the underlying – that is, our ability to trade such underlying. In the \\nmulti-asset case, which digital barrier shift should be applied? One can be conservative and \\napply a unique shift taking into account the lowest liquidity (hedged against the highest risk \\naround the barrier). Otherwise, one can apply individual shifts depending on the different \\nstocks’ average daily traded volumes. \\n11.3.3 Volatility Models for  Digitals \\nTo correctly  price  a digital one must use a model that knows about skew. Recall from equation \\n(11.1) the effect of  skew on the price of a digital that must be accounted for. If the option’s \\npayoff is only a function of the returns of the underlying at maturity, then it is imperative to get \\nthat particular skew correct in the calibration and we would use the exact date-ﬁtting model \\ndescribed in section 4.3.3. In fact, using any model that offers the same ﬁt to the skew will \\nprice the digital (almost) exactly the same. The reason is that, as discussed above, the digital \\ncan be thought of as a limit of a call spread, and capturing the skew means that the implied \\nvolatilities of these calls are correct in the model. \\nIf there  is  path dependency, like the case of the one-touch American digital, then we need \\nto use a form of smooth surface calibration, as described in section 4.3.3, in order to capture \\nthe effect of surface through time. Speciﬁcally, because the digital can be triggered at any \\ntime prior to maturity, the volatility hedge will need to consist of a set of European options \\nwith different maturities, i.e. Vega buckets. The American digital will have Vega sensitivity to \\nthe volatilities of these Europeans and we need the model to be calibrated to them in order to \\nshow risk against them. As such they can serve as valid hedging instruments and the model \\nprice will reﬂect this. As the market moves, the volatility sensitivities can change, for example \\nwhen the underlying moves closer to the barrier, and thus the model dynamic speciﬁed will \\ngive different model dependent prices for American digitals. \\nIn the multi-asset  cases the calibration will need to be done to each of the respective implied \\nvolatility surfaces of the individual underlyings. In the case of the European digital we are \\nconcerned with getting the skew correct for each underlying, calibrating to European options \\nof the same maturity as the digital. In the multi-asset case we also need to get the term \\nstructure right because an American digital will have a Vega to each underlying and for all \\nbuckets. If the digital is on multiple assets, for example a digital call on the worst-of, then \\nagain the dispersion effects will mean that these sensitivities change as the underlyings move \\nafter inception: sensitivities increase across all the Vega buckets on those underlyings that are \\nperforming worst and will decrease on those that are performing better, and are all relative to 178 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nthe position of the spots with respect to the barrier. In the multi-asset case, all payoffs discussed \\nare sensitive to the correlations between the various underlyings. The effects on the digital \\nagain depend on the nature in which the multi-asset feature enters, e.g. basket, worst-of, etc. \\nThese correlations must be correctly speciﬁed by the criteria laid out in Chapter 7 and also by \\nobserving the correlation sensitivity of the seller of such options. \\n11.4 STRUCTURED PRODUCTS INVOLVING \\nEUROPEAN\\n DIGITALS \\n11.4.1 Strip of Digitals Note  \\nPayoff Mec hanism \\nThis\\n structured  note  is based on the performance of a single asset and its payoff structure is \\ndescribed as follows: At each observation date t , the holder receives a variable coupon equal \\nto: \\nCoupon( t) =  C × Notional × 1{Ret( t)>H } \\nwhere H is the predetermined trigger level, C is the ﬁxed digital coupon and Ret( t) = S(t )/S(0) \\nis the return at time t w.r.t. the initial level S(0). This note is capital guaranteed, and the holder \\nreceives the following payoff at maturity T : \\nNote payoff = 100% + Coupon( T ) \\nwhere Coupon( T )  is the ﬁnal coupon. \\nConsider the follo wing scenario. After a market crash, an investor believes that the main \\nEuropean stocks will recover their losses and perform by at least 5% per annum for four or \\nﬁve years. The investor then buys a 5-year maturity strip of digitals structured note on the \\nEuroStoxx index that has the following payoff: At the end of each year, if the spot of the \\nEuroStoxx index is higher than 105% of its initial level, the investor receives a coupon of \\n10%. Moreover, this is a capital guaranteed structure since the investor receives his initial \\ninvestment back at maturity. \\nIn the case  described in Table 11.3, the holder of the strip of digitals note receives a coupon \\nof 10% at the end of the second and fourth year since the index value is higher than 105% \\nof its initial value. At maturity, he receives 100% of the notional as well as a coupon of 10% \\nbecause the value of the EuroStoxx at maturity is higher than 105%. \\nTable 11.3 A payoff scenario for a strip of digitals note. \\nS(t )/S(0) 105% barrier reached Coupon \\nEnd of year 1 98% No 0% \\nEnd of year 2 106% Yes 10% \\nEnd of year 3 103% No 0% \\nEnd of year 4 108% Yes 10% \\nEnd of year 5 114% Yes 100% + 10% /bracketleftBigg /parenleftBigg /parenrightBigg/bracketrightBigg /summationdisplay Digitals 179 \\nProduct Structure and Risk Analysis \\nThe non-risk y  part of this product is a zero coupon bond that redeems 100% of invested capital \\nat maturity. The risky part is in fact a set of different European digitals starting at the start \\ndate of the note and having maturities corresponding to the different observation dates. The \\nexample of the strip of digitals note described above is in fact composed of a zero coupon \\nbond plus a set of ﬁve European digitals having respective maturities equal to 1, 2, 3, 4 and \\n5 years. The barrier level is equal to 105% of the initial spot of the EuroStoxx index. \\nTo price  a  strip of digitals, we have to price the individual digitals separately since they are \\nall independent. To do so, we should compute the sum of discounted probabilities of being \\nin-the-money for the different digitals and multiply these probabilities by the coupon paid. \\nThe seller  of  a strip of digitals note is short the digitals. Therefore, the trader taking a short \\nposition in this structure is short the forward price of the underlying share and will need to \\nbuy Delta in the underlying asset on day 1, and adjust dynamically through the life of the trade \\nto remain Delta neutral. The seller will be short interest rates, long borrow costs and long \\ndividends, short skew and long the barrier. \\nThe position  in  volatility is not obvious. In order to check his assumptions on his position \\nin volatility, a trader selling this structure can have a look at the different undiscounted \\nprobabilities of being in-the-money and make sure that maturity decreases these probabilities \\nin case he is long volatility or increases the probabilities if he is short volatility. \\n11.4.2 Growth and Income  \\nPayoff Mec hanism \\nT\\no keep things  simple, let’s describe the payoff associated with the Growth and Income \\nstructure as a note based on a single asset. As is the case for the strip of digitals structure, \\nthe Growth and Income note pays the holder periodic coupons depending on the underlying’s \\nperformances reaching a predetermined trigger H . At each observation date t, the holder \\nreceives a variable coupon equal to: \\nCoupon( t) =  C × Notional × 1{Ret(t )>H } \\nwhere H is the predetermined trigger level, C is the ﬁxed digital coupon and Ret( t) = S(t)/S(0) \\nis the return at time t w.r.t. the initial level S(0). \\nThis note is capital  guaranteed, and the holder receives the following payoff at maturity T : \\nNote payoff = 100% + Coupon( T ) + max 0; Ret( T ) − 1 + Coupon( t ) \\nt<T \\nwhere Coupon( T ) is the ﬁnal coupon, and the sum inside the payoff is over all coupons paid \\nup to, but not including, T . \\nThe idea behind  this product is to add an additional opportunity to capture the ﬁnal perfor -\\nmance of the  underlying in case the holder did not receive very much in previous coupons. \\nNow, let’s consider  the case of Linda Edgeworth, an investor who has a bullish view on the \\nbanking sector. She believes that in the next 5 years Goldman Sachs’ stock will not drop below \\n100% of its current spot price. She decides to buy a 5-year Growth and Income note structure. \\nAt the end of each year, we observe Goldman Sachs’ spot price; if it is higher than 100% of its \\ninitial value, the investor receives a coupon of 8% on a notional of $10 million. At maturity, 180 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nTable 11.4 Payof f scenario for a Growth and Income note. \\nS(t)/S(0) 100% barrier reached Annual coupon \\nEnd\\n of year 1 97% No 0% \\nEnd of year 2 106% Yes 8% \\nEnd of year 3 115% Yes 8% \\nEnd of year 4 131% Yes 8% \\nEnd of year 5 147% Yes 131% \\nin addition to the ﬁfth year’s conditional coupon, if the ﬁnal performance of Goldman Sachs’ \\nstock is higher than the sum of already paid coupons, the investor receives a coupon equal to \\nGoldman Sachs’ ﬁnal performance minus the sum of already paid coupons as well as 100% \\nof its invested capital. In Table 11.4, the investor receives three annual coupons of $800,000 \\nat the end of years 2, 3 and 4. At maturity, the note pays the holder a coupon of $13,100,000. \\nThis coupon is computed as follows: \\n⎡ ⎤ \\n100% + 8% + max ⎣0 , 47% − 24% ⎦ = 131%  /bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright  /bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright /bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright  /bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright  \\nguaranteed capital digital breached perf at maturity coupons paid \\nProduct Structure and Risk Analysis \\nThe Growth and  Income note is capital protected since the buyer is long a zero coupon bond \\nhaving the same maturity as the note plus an option structure. The risky part is composed \\nof a series of digitals paying a predetermined periodic coupon when the underlying stock \\nprice is higher than a speciﬁc trigger. At maturity, the holder is also long an out-of-the-money \\nEuropean call option with strike level equal to 100% plus the sum of coupons already paid by \\nthe digitals. \\nIn the e xample described above, the risky part consists of ﬁve European digitals, each paying \\na coupon of 8%, triggered at 100% and respectively expiring after 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years; as \\nwell as a path-dependent 5-year maturity European call striking at 100% + Sum of perceived \\ncoupons. \\nTo price  the  Growth and Income option, we have to price the set of individual digitals as \\nwell as the out-of-the-money European call. Concerning digital pricing, the risks are identical \\nto those associated with the strip of digitals described in section 11.4.1. The trader selling \\nthese digitals will need to buy Delta in each of the underlying assets on day 1, and adjust \\ndynamically through the life of the trade to remain Delta neutral. The seller is short interest \\nrates, long borrow costs, long dividends. He also has a short skew position and a long barrier \\nposition. The volatility position depends on the underlying stock forward price and the digitals’ \\ntrigger. \\nConcerning the out-of-the-mone y call option pricing, one should note that it is not a simple \\nEuropean call since it is now a path-dependent option. The trader selling this call will need to \\nbuy Delta in the underlying asset on day 1, and adjust dynamically through the life of the trade \\nto remain Delta neutral. The seller is short interest rates, long borrow costs, long dividends. \\nHe is also short volatility since he is selling a call option. The trader selling a Growth and \\nIncome note should check the overall position in volatility. /parenleftBig /parenrightBig Digitals 181 \\nThe skew effect is interesting in this case. In fact, skew will decrease the price of the out-\\nof-the-money call, so there is a skew beneﬁt for the buyer. Moreover, since skew increases the \\nprice of digitals, this means that skew increases the probabilities of coupons paid. This effect \\nenhances the probability of a higher strike which, in turn, increases the skew beneﬁt on the \\ncall since it makes it more out-of-the-money. This is called the second skew effect. Therefore, \\none should be cautious with respect to the overall effect of the skew but, generally, the skew \\nsensitivity of the digitals is higher in absolute value than that of the out-of-the-money call. \\nThus, skew usually increases the price of the Growth and Income note. \\nExtending the discussion  of volatility models in section 11.3.3, there is a need for caution. \\nAlthough the digitals are not path dependent and can be priced by an exact ﬁtting of the skew \\nat the correct dates, the call option is path dependent and needs a smooth ﬁtting across all \\nthese dates. \\n11.4.3 Bonus Steps  Certiﬁcate  \\nPayoff Mec hanism \\nThe\\n Bonus  Steps  certiﬁcate is a capital guaranteed structure that pays the holder periodic \\ncoupons based on the worst performing stock reaching two speciﬁc barrier levels H1 and H2. \\nLet’s consider an underlying basket with n assets S 1, S2,..., Sn , then a Bonus Steps certiﬁcate \\nmakes the following periodic payment (Coupon( t )) at each observation date t equal to \\nCoupon( t) =  C × Notional × 1{(min i =1,...,n Perf i (t))>H1 }+ 1{(min i =1,...,n Perf i (t ))>H2 } \\nwhere C is the ﬁxed digital coupon and Perf i (t) = Si (t )/Si (0) is the performance of asset i at \\ntime t w.r.t. the initial level Si (0). This certiﬁcate is capital guaranteed. The holder receives \\nthe following payoff at maturity T : \\nCertiﬁcate payoff = 100% + Coupon( T ) \\nwhere Coupon( T )  is the ﬁnal coupon. \\nNow, let’s tak e the case of Alan Grieves, an investor who believes that the American \\neconomy is going into a growth period at least for the next 3 years. He has strong expectations \\non 24 stocks that are very highly rated by most equity analysts. He also believes that none of \\nthese stocks will drop below 90% of its initial value. He then decides to invest in a certiﬁcate \\nwith a payoff based on the worst performing stock to increase his potential upside leverage \\nin the case where no share falls below 90%. He is also aware that everything could happen \\nin the market and wants to have additional protection in case his view on the underlyings is \\nnot realized. He therefore speciﬁes a second trigger equal to 75% which enables him to have \\na lower coupon if one of the 24 underlyings loses more than 10% of its initial value but less \\nthan 25%. \\nAlan calls a  structured equity salesperson in an investment bank and says he wants to invest \\n$20 million in a note that has a payoff corresponding to his view on the market.

To price a Bonus Steps \\ncertiﬁcate, we have to price the worst-of individual digitals. To do so, we should compute the \\nsum of discounted probabilities of being in-the-money for the different digitals and multiply \\nthese probabilities by the value of the coupon. \\nThe seller  of  this structure is exposed to the same risks associated with worst-of digitals. The \\nseller will need to buy Delta in each of the underlying assets on day 1, and adjust dynamically \\nthrough the life of the trade to remain Delta neutral.

Digitals 183 \\n11.5 STRUCTURED PRODUCTS  INVOLVING \\nAMERICAN DIGITALS \\n11.5.1 Wedding Cake  \\nThe wedding  cak e is an option that pays a ﬁxed payout based on the movement of the underlying \\nreference rate within certain predeﬁned barriers. It will typically pay a lower coupon where \\nthe reference rate moves within the wider range, or no coupon if it touches the outside barrier \\nlevels. See Figure 11.8 for the payoff of a wedding cake structure. \\nThe structure  can  be thought of as a set of two-sided no-touch digitals. In the example in \\nFigure 11.8, the wedding cake structure pays a 15% coupon at maturity, provided the underlying \\nnever went outside the range [95%, 105%]. It pays a coupon of 10% if the underlying goes \\noutside the ﬁrst range but does not exit from the second range [90%, 110%]. It pays a coupon \\nof 5% if the second range has ever been breached but not the third range [85%, 115%], and it \\npays zero if the third range has ever been breached. \\nThis can be  broken down into three two-sided no-touch digitals in the following sense: start \\nwith a digital that pays 5% if the underlying is never outside the range [85%, 115%], add to this \\na second digital that also pays 5% if the range [90%, 110%] is never breached, and similarly \\nanother no-touch of coupon 5% and range [95%, 105%]. Pricing each of these separately and \\nadding them together gives us the price of the structure. \\nThe question  no w is, does the two sided no-touch introduce any new risks with which we \\nare not already familiar? Well not really. One would want to employ barrier shifts at both \\nsides, in whatever manner one does one’s barrier shifting, and deﬁnitely account for the skew \\nsensitivity of the trade. \\nAn increase  in  volatility can increase the probability of the underlying hitting the barriers \\nthus lowering the price, meaning that the seller of the structure is typically long volatility. \\nHow sensitive we are to volatility movements will be a function of the size of the ranges and \\ncoupons, and can also depend on the forward of the underlying. \\nThis product  is  an example of the curvature effect of the skew. That is, the skew sensitivities \\non each side of the digitals cancel each other out somewhat, assuming the skew is relatively \\nnon-convex. We refer to section 4.2.1 on volatility skew parameterization and analysis.

This can be used to obtain an above \\nmarket coupon by taking a view on the path of an underlying, or can be used to hedge other \\nrisks. The payoff is given by \\nC Range Accrual payoff = × 1{L<S(t)<H }n t∈{0,t1 ,t2 ,..., tn } \\nwhere 0, t1, t2,..., tn are the days from 0 (start) to T (maturity). [L , H ] is the prespeciﬁed \\nrange. For each day it is in the range, the sum accrues; this is then divided by n, the number of \\ndays in the range, to give us the percentage of days it is in the range; this is then multiplied by \\na coupon. Obviously one speciﬁes in the contract that we are only counting business days – \\nfor example, we will consider the days in the range and divide by 252 for a 1-year maturity, \\nrepresenting the number of trading days in the year. It is more important to get the correct \\nnumber of days the underlying trades between the start and maturity of the option. \\nAs an e xample see Figure 11.9, where the range is speciﬁed at [90%, 110%], and let’s \\nassume a coupon of 12%. The underlying spends 144 days within the range, maturity is 1 \\nyear (252 trading days) so we have the fraction 144/252 = 57.14%, thus the option pays \\n12% × 57.14% = 6.86%. \\nWe can specify  this option with a minimum payoff at maturity, a minimum guarantee \\n(MinGtee), for example \\n⎡ ⎤ \\nC\\n ⎦ Range Accrual payoff = max ⎣MinGtee, × 1{L<S(t )<H }n t∈{0,t1 ,t2 ,...,t n } \\n110% 100% \\n90% 80% \\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 225 250 \\nIn the range Out of range \\nFigure 11.9 A [90%, 110%] range accrual scenario.

The bold part of the time axis represents the days of accrual.

Since the payoff is positive in all cases, a minimum value of zero \\n(a global ﬂoor) makes no sense. This can also be structured as a swap, where, for example, \\nthe investor pays LIBOR plus a speciﬁc spread, and the other party pays an equity contingent \\ncoupon according to the range accrual. \\nObviously the analysis  for a range accrual depends on where the range is speciﬁed. But \\ngenerally, with a range similar to the one speciﬁed, it is tailored towards the view that one \\nexpects relatively ﬂat volatility in the underlying. Taking a range below the spot (or around the \\nspot with more weight on the downside, for example [80%, 100%]) to give it a bearish view, \\nthe opposite can be done for a bullish view. \\nOne can think  of a range accrual as a set of daily no-touch digitals. To obtain a higher \\ncoupon one can introduce a multi-asset component and bring dispersion into the picture. Let’s \\nassume that we have N assets and we specify the range accrual as \\nCN \\nRange Accrual payoff = × 1{L<Sj (t)<H }n t∈{0,t1 ,t2 ,..., tn } j =1 \\nThe product in the formula means that the indicator 1 is only equal to 1 if ALL N underlyings \\nare within the range. For example, the world basket could form our three assets, and the range \\nspeciﬁed according to a view on the three global indices. \\nThe seller  of  the range accrual in the multi-asset case speciﬁed as above is long dispersion: \\nas dispersion goes up, one of the assets will probably leave the range. The seller is short \\ncorrelation and long volatility, but caution must be taken as the size of the range and the \\nposition of the range can change the effects of these. \\nIf we think  about a range accrual as a set of forward starting daily digitals, we can see \\nthat because of its path-dependent nature, the dynamics of the model speciﬁed will have an \\nimpact on the price of the range accrual. If we are concerned with the effect of future volatility \\nimplied by the model, we will need to use a stochastic volatility model to capture this. These \\nare discussed at length when we look at cliquets in Chapter 13, and implied smile dynamics \\nin Chapter 15 in the context of mountain range options. Whichever model is chosen must be \\ncorrectly calibrated to obtain as smooth a calibration through time as possible to European \\noptions of different maturities, the Vega buckets. \\n11.6 OUTPERFORMANCE DIGITAL  \\n11.6.1 Payoff Mechanism \\nThe\\n outperformance  digital  option is a variation of the outperformance option. Let’s consider \\ntwo assets S1 and S2. A digital option based on the outperformance of S1 vs S2 is typically a \\nEuropean style option that pays a coupon C at maturity if S1 outperforms S2. The payoff is as \\nfollows: \\nOutperformance Digital payoff = C × Notional × 1{Ret 1(T )>Ret 2(T )} \\nwhere Ret i (T ) = Si (T )/Si (0). \\nNow, let’s tak e the example of an English investor who believes that major European stocks \\nwill perform better than American stocks in the next couple of years. He thinks the EuroStoxx \\nindex will outperform the S&P index but the spread between the performances of these indices \\nwill not be very big. He decides to buy a 2-year maturity outperformance digital option on 186 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nTable 11.6 Payof f scenarios of an outperformance digital. \\nOutperformance coupon set at 20%. \\nEuroStoxx 50 return S&P 500 return  P ayoff \\nScenario 1 93%  85% 20% \\nScenario 2 98%  104% 0% \\nScenario 3 119%  98% 20% \\nScenario 4 76%  75% 20% \\nEuroStoxx vs S&P that pays him a predetermined variable coupon of 20% on a notional of \\n$20 million (Table 11.6). \\n11.6.2 Correlation Skew  and Other Risks \\nWhen pricing  and  hedging this option, one should be careful because the payoff of an out-\\nperformance digital  looks  similar to that of an outperformance option, but the volatility and \\ncorrelation sensitivities are quite different. The trader taking a short position in the outperfor -\\nmance digital  option  described above is obviously short the EuroStoxx index forward price \\nand long the S&P forward price. But it is much more complicated for him to determine his \\nposition in volatility and correlation. \\nIf the forw ard performance of EuroStoxx is higher than the forward performance of S&P, \\nthen a higher dispersion decreases the price of the outperformance digital. Otherwise, disper -\\nsion increases  its  price. Therefore, if one is selling an outperformance digital, his position in \\nvolatility and correlation depends on the difference between the underlying’s forwards. \\nCorrelation, like  volatility, has a relationship with the underlying price. In equity markets, \\nfor large moves down, we see an increase in correlation. This is what we call correlation \\nskew. Since the position in correlation can potentially change during the life of the option, one \\nshould use a stochastic correlation model to capture this effect or to at least be able to notice \\nthe existence of such an effect and be able to quantify it. \\nThe issue  is  linked to convexity – that is, a second-order effect, in much the same way \\nthat an ordinary call option has Gamma. In this case it is insufﬁcient to measure a correlation \\nsensitivity by computing a ﬁrst-order derivative w.r.t. correlation. Since the price is no longer \\nlinear in correlation, and this sensitivity may change, the seller should see the second-order \\neffect. The correlation convexity is not something that can be directly or easily hedged, and \\nthus seeing its effect through the use of a correlation skew model is purely to include its effect \\nin the price, if nothing else as a ﬁxed charge for bearing the additional risk. If one knows the \\nmagnitude of this effect, then a simple edge can be taken onto the price without the added \\nmodelling complexity. \\nAlthough this ef fect is present in the outperformance digital, one must ﬁrst be sure to take \\nthe volatility skew sensitivity of the product into account. The product is a digital and thus \\ncarries skew risk and is sensitive to the implied volatility skews of both underlyings. Again, \\nthe time ﬁtting will depend on whether we base the payoff on the return at maturity or if we \\nintroduce some form of path dependency through averaging, which will introduce sensitivity \\nto the volatility term structure. 12 \\nAutocallable Structures \\nOur greatest glory is not in never falling, but in getting up every time we do. \\nConfucius \\nAutocallables, which are also known as auto-trigger structures, are quite popular in the world \\nof structured products. In this chapter, we look at standard autocallables and several variants \\non them. Firstly, we discuss autocallables based on a single asset, deﬁning their features and \\nexplaining the payoff mechanism. Then, we present the payoffs of Twin-Wins and autocallables \\nwith bonus coupons, which are both great examples of autocallables with down-and-in put \\nfeatures. The pricing and the risks associated with single asset autocallables are fully covered. \\nThe second  part  of this chapter deals with the dispersion effect on autocallables. We ﬁrst \\ndescribe the payoff of worst-of autocallables as well as the risks encountered when trading \\nthese products. Then, we introduce the effect of snowballing coupons as well as the addition of \\na worst-of down-and-in put feature to the classical worst-of autocallable structure. Finally, we \\nanalyse the payoff and the risks associated with trading outperformance autocallables which \\nalso deal with dispersion. \\n12.1 SINGLE ASSET AUT OCALLABLES \\n12.1.1 General Features \\nP\\nayoff Description  \\nConsider\\n an autocallable  note based on a single asset S, a structure which pays coupons \\ndepending on the underlying’s performance reaching two triggers H and B, and has a payoff \\ndeﬁned as follows: at each observation date ti , (i = 1 ... n)w eh a v e \\nCoupon( ti ) = Notional × C × 1{Ret( ti )≥B}× 1{max j =1,..., i −1(Ret( tj ))<H } \\nwhere C is  a predetermined coupon and Ret( ti ) = S(ti )/S(0) is the return at time ti w.r.t. the \\ninitial level S(0). \\nSince the wrapper  is a note, the holder receives back 100% of the notional except that, in \\nthis case, the time of payment is not ﬁxed. The notional redemption can be at any observation \\ndate, not necessarily at maturity. \\nRedemption(t i ) = Notional × 1{Ret( ti )≥H }× 1{max j =1,..., i −1(Ret( tj ))<H } \\nFrom the payof f described above, it is important to notice that the holder of the note receives \\nno further payments if H has been breached on one of the observation dates. Then, this \\nnote is described as an autocallable since the note dies once the barrier H is breached by \\nthe underlying at speciﬁc observation dates. The autocallable structure doesn’t have a ﬁxed \\nmaturity. What we call maturity is in fact the maximum duration this product can stay alive. 188 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nTable 12.1 Payof f scenarios for a 3-year autocallable note on the CAC 40 \\nindex. This table is associated with the scenarios drawn in Figure 12.1. \\nScenario 1 Scenario  2 Scenario  3 \\nCoupon\\n at the end  of year 1 8% 8% 8% \\nCoupon at the end  of year 2 8% 8% 0% \\nCoupon at the end  of year 3 100% 108% 108% \\nH is called the autocall trigger or threshold . It is a predetermined level above which the \\nautocallable structure expires and the investor receives the notional invested when the structure \\nis a note. The threshold can be ﬁxed during the life of the option or can be variable. In some \\ncases, the threshold can be increasing or decreasing as time goes by. \\nB is the  coupon trigger, also called coupon level. It is a predetermined level above which \\nthe investor receives a periodic coupon. In other words, if the underlying level observed is \\nhigher than the coupon trigger, a coupon based on the notional is paid to the investor. \\nSome autocallable  structures  are characterized by a coupon trigger equal to the autocall \\ntrigger. In this case, we talk about autocallables with knock-out coupons. Indeed, when a \\ncoupon is paid, the product autocalls at the same time since the autocall trigger is breached. \\nTherefore, this structure pays a unique coupon at one of the observation dates during the \\nlifetime of the option. In the case of a coupon level different from the autocall trigger, one \\ntalks about autocallables with knock-in coupons, as is the case in the payoff described above. \\nAlso note that the coupon level is always lower or equal to the autocall level; otherwise the \\nproduct doesn’t make sense. \\nPayoff Mec hanism \\nHere,\\n we clarify  the payoff mechanism by simulating scenarios, shown in Tables 12.1 and \\n12.2, on a speciﬁc case to be more familiar with the behaviour of an autocallable structure. \\nConsider a retail  client of an investment bank who invests $5 million in a 3-year maturity \\nautocallable note on the CAC 40 index (Figures 12.1 and 12.2). Each year, we observe the \\nperformance of the underlying index since inception Ret( ti ) = I (ti )/I (0). If this return is \\nhigher than 70%, the client is paid a coupon equal to $400,000, which is 8% of the notional \\ninvested. Moreover, if the observed level of the CAC 40 index is higher than 100%, the structure \\nautocalls and the investor gets back the money he invested. At the end of the third year, if the \\nindex level has never been above 100%, the investor gets back the capital he invested. \\nTable 12.2 Payoff scenarios for a 3-year autocallable note on the \\nCAC 40 index.

Case where the structure never autocalled. \\nRisk Analysis In order  to\\n  price the autocallable digitals effectively, one can compute the undiscounted \\nconditional probabilities of receiving the coupons. These values can enable one to quickly \\ncheck whether the pricing makes sense. After these probabilities are computed, they should \\nbe discounted and multiplied by the coupons to be received. This gives us the price of the \\nautocallable digitals. \\nThe ﬁrst digital  option is a classical European digital. The undiscounted probability of \\nstriking the second year is conditional on not autocalling at the end of the ﬁrst year. The \\nundiscounted probability of striking the third year is conditional on not autocalling at the end \\nof the ﬁrst and second years. As time goes by, the probabilities of coupons being paid decrease \\nand the value of the last path-dependent digitals can be very small because the conditional \\nprobabilities of striking would be low. In this case, the seller must be careful when offering a \\nvery large digital with a low probability. \\nThe risks  associated  with a single asset autocallable structure are similar to those associated \\nwith single asset digitals. The risk analysis on digitals having been fully detailed in Chapter \\n11, we could say that the seller of an autocallable is short the underlying’s forward (short \\ninterest rates, long dividends and long borrowing costs), short the skew, and long the coupon \\ntrigger. \\n90% 100% 120% \\n110% Year 2 Year 1 Year 3 \\nScenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 \\nFigure 12.2 CAC 40 index return scenarios. Case where the structure autocalled. 190 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nThe position in volatility depends on the coupon level and the forward price of the under -\\nlying. As already  mentioned, the Vega of digitals is positive if the underlying’s forward price \\nis lower than the trigger; otherwise, Vega is negative. The Vega hedge will consist of a set of \\nEuropean options with strikes matching (as closely as possible) the autocall trigger dates. The \\noverall volatility sensitivity is split over these Vega buckets, and each of these sensitivities will \\nchange as the market moves. If an autocall event is about to happen, the short-term Vega will \\nincrease and the Vega in the other buckets will decrease, in line with the higher probability \\nof autocalling. A Vega hedge set at inception will need to be readjusted if the market moves \\nsigniﬁcantly in relation to the autocall triggers. \\nFrom a pricing  perspective, the autocall structure either autocalls the ﬁrst year, or tends to \\nstay alive until maturity. This means that if the underlying asset doesn’t reach the autocall \\ntrigger the ﬁrst year, it is less likely to strike in the next years, which is in line with the decreasing \\nconditional probabilities of autocalling. However, from a utility perspective, autocallables are \\ntypically structured to ﬁt a certain price range, and lower probabilities, for the same price, \\nimply higher coupons. If the investors do not get the above market coupon in the ﬁrst year, \\nthey still stand to make coupons in subsequent years. The market could crash during the ﬁrst \\nyear, but recover and trigger the autocall event in a subsequent year. \\n12.1.2 Interest Rate/Equity  Corr elation \\nThe autocallable  serv es as an example of a structure where the correlation between the equity \\nand interest rates has an effect on the price. The autocallable is redeemed at a time in the future \\nthat is a function of the path the underlying equity takes. Assume the investor is paying the \\nbank LIBOR in exchange for this equity exposure, then the duration of the swap is dependent \\non the equity and thus the structure is sensitive to the correlation between interest rates and the \\nequity underlying. In the case where an autocallable is structured to provide equity exposure \\nas part of a note, then the investor is in this case implicitly short the ﬂoating leg of an interest \\nrate swap and the same thing holds. \\nIn the case  of the autocallable, the pricing of this correlation effect is typically done by \\ntaking a small margin. This can be speciﬁed by ﬁrst deciding on the level of correlation and \\nalso the length of the trade. To get an idea about this effect we use a hedging argument and \\nanalyse the possible cases. Let’s start with a 2-year maturity autocallable with a possible \\nautocall date at the end of the ﬁrst year. Setting aside the equity component that will be Delta \\nhedged using the underlying equity, we look at the interest rate hedge of the seller. The seller \\nof this autocallable will go long zero coupon bonds with respective maturities of 1 and 2 years. \\n• First case:  Assume  that the equity/interest rate correlation is positive. If the underlying \\nincreases, then the probability of early redemption at the ﬁrst autocall date increases, \\nand to adjust the interest rate hedge accordingly the seller will increase the amount of \\n1-year bonds held and sell some of the 2-year bonds. Because of the positive correlation \\nin this case between the underlying equity and interest rates, we expect that interest rates \\nwill also increase on average, and thus the price of the zero coupon bonds will decrease. \\nSince the bond with the longer maturity decreases more in value than the bond with the \\nshorter maturity (using simple bond maths) the seller nets a loss on the rebalancing of this \\nhedge because the seller is buying one bond but selling the one that decreased more in \\nvalue. 191 Autocallable Structures \\nIf the underlying decreases, then the probability of the structure autocalling early de-\\ncreases. In this  case the seller must adjust the interest rate Delta hedge by selling some of \\nthe 1-year zero coupon bonds held and buying more of the 2-year bonds. On average we \\nexpect that interest rates will also decline because of the positive correlation. This implies \\nthat the 2-year bond will increase in value more than the 1-year bond, and again the seller \\nthus nets a loss on the rebalancing of this hedge. \\n• Second case:  Assume  that the equity/interest rate correlation is negative. If the underlying \\nincreases, the opposite happens. We expect the interest rate in this case to decline, on \\naverage, and the same rebalancing as the case of increased possibility of early redemption \\nas above will in this case net the seller a proﬁt. \\nIf the underlying  decreases, then again the opposite happens: negative correlation means \\nthat we expect rates to go up and thus reduce the price of the 2-year bond more than the \\n1-year bond. The decreased probability of early redemption means the seller will need to \\nbuy more of the 2-year bond and sell some of the 1-year bond, thus netting a proﬁt. \\nThe upshot  of  this analysis is that the autocallable’s price should be higher when a positive \\ncorrelation is assumed between interest rates and the underlying equity, and lower if the \\ncorrelation is negative. The question thus arises as to whether we should employ a model that \\nincludes stochastic rates, and thus be able to enter a value for this correlation and include its \\nimpact in the price. Arguments in favour of the use of such models are discussed by Giese \\n(2006) for example, and the impact on pricing is discussed and concluded to be important. \\nHowever, although using such models allows one to see this impact, they do not give us \\nadditional information regarding the hedging of the equity interest rate correlation. If it is \\nagreed that assuming a positive correlation implies that there should be an additional cost, \\nthen one can simply add a cost for the interest rate equity correlation to the price and not use \\nsuch models. Speciﬁcally, since the sign of this correlation governs whether there is a cost \\nor a beneﬁt, deciding on which correlation to use and adding a cost accordingly can be done \\nwithout having to employ a stochastic rates model. \\nThe magnitude  of  this cost will be a function of the maturity of the structure. If we assume, \\nin the above analysis that the autocallable has a 3-year maturity, with annual autocall dates, \\nthen the same hedging argument holds, only the Delta hedge for interest rates will include the \\n1- and 3-year bonds. The impact of a move in interest rates is greater on a 3-year bond than \\non a 2-year bond and thus the impact of the correlation is greater the longer the maturity of \\nthe autocall structure. If one wants to assume a positive correlation and thus add a cost to this \\nstructure, it can easily be set to 10 bp per annum for example, depending on the aggressiveness \\nof the trader, the view on this correlation, the notional size of the trade and thus size of the \\nrisk, and the level of competition involved in winning the trade. \\nThe use of  stochastic interest rate models and the importance of the correlation between rates \\nand equities becomes more signiﬁcant when we discuss hybrids in Chapter 17. But generally \\nwe can say here that since this correlation cannot be hedged in a straightforward manner, and \\nperhaps not hedged at all, the best thing to do is decide on the level for this correlation and add \\na cost (or nothing) accordingly. To trade this correlation, and thus hedge this correlation risk, \\none would need a liquid structure involving equity and interest rates, from which one could \\nextract this correlation by hedging away the other parameters. \\nNote that, from  the investor’s point of view, a positive correlation would imply that he is \\nlikely to get his above market autocall coupon and his money back in a high interest rate \\nenvironment. This is a good scenario for the investor. /bracketleftbig /bracketrightbig 192 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nUnderlying asset Alpha \\nNotional $10 million \\nCurrency USD \\nMaturity 3 years \\nAutocall level 110%, 120% \\nAutocall frequency Annual \\nCoupon level 110%, 120% \\nCoupon frequency Annual \\nCoupon value 10% per annum \\nParticipation 250% \\nNote price 98% \\nCapital protected Ye s \\nFigure 12.3 The terms of a 3-year autocallable participating note. \\n12.2 AUTOCALLABLE PARTICIPATING NOTE  \\nThe autocallable participating note (APN) is an interesting structure that offers 100% capital \\nprotection and can be used to take advantage of a bull market. Let’s consider a share Alpha that \\nis near an all time high. An investor may consider converting a portion of his Alpha portfolio \\ninto an autocallable participating note (Figure 12.3), thus locking in the current gains (since \\nthe note offers 100% principal protection) yet retaining the ability to proﬁt from continuing \\nappreciation, via an autocallable structure with 250% participation in case the note has never \\nbeen autocalled. \\nThe note described  in Figure 12.3 makes the following payments: \\nAPN payoff (t1) = 110% × Notional × 1{Ret( t1)≥110% } \\nAPN payoff (t2) = 110% × Notional × 1{Ret( t2)≥120% }× 1{Ret( t1)<110%} \\nAPN payoff (T ) = Notional × 1 + Participation × max (0, Ret( T ) − 1) \\n×1{Ret( t1)<110%}× 1{Ret( t2)<120%} \\nwhere T is the maturity (end of year 3) and t1, t2 are the annual observation dates that occur \\nrespectively at the end of the ﬁrst and second year. Ret( ti ) = S(ti )/S(0) is the return at time ti \\nw.r.t. the initial le vel S(0). The price of this note is equal to 98% of the notional. This means \\nthat the holder will receive 100% of the notional, which is more than the money invested no \\nmatter what the performance of the underlying. \\nIt’s interesting  to  note that the APN offers 100% capital protection, multiple lock-in proﬁt \\nlevels as well as an uncapped 250% participation in the appreciation of Alpha shares if not \\nautocalled. Compared to holding these shares outright, the investor loses his dividends, in \\nreturn for 100% capital protection plus autocall coupons at roughly three times the USD \\ninterest rate (assuming USD rates are roughly 3%) and 250% participation in the stock upside \\nif not autocalled. \\nThe ﬁrst scenario  (Table 12.3) shows the case of Alpha breaching the ﬁrst trigger (110%) \\nat the end of year 1. The APN pays the holder of the note a coupon of 10% plus 100% of the \\nnotional at the end of the ﬁrst year. The APN expires at t1. \\nIn the second  scenario, no coupon is paid at t1 since the ﬁrst trigger is not breached at this \\ndate. At observation date t2, the return of Alpha is higher than the second trigger (120%), then \\nthe holder receives 10% coupon plus 100% of the notional and the APN expires. 193 Autocallable Structures \\nT\\nable 12.3 Payof f scenarios for a 3-year autocallable participating \\nnote.

At t1, no coupon is paid since the return of Alpha is \\nlower than 110%. At t2, no coupon is paid either since the return of Alpha is equal to 111.6%, \\nwhich is higher than the ﬁrst trigger but lower than the second trigger (120%). At maturity, the \\nreturn of Alpha is equal to 110.48%; thus according to the payoff formula, the holder receives \\na payment at the end of year 3 equal to: \\n100% +250%  ×max  [0, 110.48% −100% ] = 126.2% \\nIn the case  described above (Figure 12.4), the autocall trigger is not ﬁxed, it’s increasing: 110% \\nat t1 and 120% at t2. Also, the coupon triggers are equal to the autocall triggers. Therefore, \\nthis note makes a unique coupon payment. Since the coupon trigger increases, the probability \\nof paying the coupon decreases which decreases the price of the autocallable digitals. \\nThe APN  is  composed of a set of path-dependent digitals plus a participation in a path-\\ndependent European call. To price this structure, one should price the digitals and add the call \\nprice. The price of the digitals is given by: \\nDigital(t i ) = C ×e−rti ×Prob ( Ret( i ) > H (i )&R e t ( 1 ) < H (1) & \\nRet(2) < H (2) & ··· &R e t ( i −1) < H (i −1) ) \\nShowing the probability  that the structure autocalls decrease as time goes by. Therefore the \\npath-dependent digitals become cheaper. Moreover, the step-up trigger decreases the price of \\nthe digitals composing the autocall structure. The probability that the APN has never autocalled \\nis a decreasing function of the expected return at maturity. Indeed, if this probability is high, \\nthis means that the expected return of the underlying is quite low (since this is the only case \\nwhere the returns would never reach the coupon trigger). Therefore the path-dependent call at \\nmaturity is cheap since it depends on two effects that offset each other. \\n90% 100% 130% 120% \\n110% Year 2 Year 1 Year 3 \\nScenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 \\nFigure 12.4 Alpha return scenarios for the autocallable participating note described in Figure 12.3. 194 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n12.3 AUTOCALLABLES WITH DOWN-AND-IN PUTS \\n12.3.1 Adding the Put  Feature \\nIf the in vestor believes that the underlying index will not be lower than a speciﬁc level at \\nmaturity, she can add a put feature to the autocallable structure to increase the potential \\ncoupon received. This means that the capital is no longer protected as the holder is short a put \\noption at maturity T . \\nThe put option  can be a vanilla at-the-money European put option whose maturity is the \\nmaturity of the autocall. But most of the time, the buyer is short a down-and-in at-the-money \\nput option that can be either European or American style. The barrier level is determined \\ndepending on the view the investor has on the underlying expected performance. \\nThe down-and-in at-the-mone y puts with daily monitored barrier are the most popular put \\nfeatures associated with autocallables. We are then going to talk essentially about these options \\nin some examples. \\nLet’s take the  example described in section 12.1: if the investor believes that the CAC 40 \\nlevel will never be below 60% in the next 3 years, he can add a 60% down-and-in at-the-\\nmoney put feature. He would then be compensated for taking this additional risk by receiving \\na coupon of, let’s say, 12% (instead of 8%) if the underlying return is higher than the coupon \\ntrigger. \\nWhen a trader  sells an autocall with a put feature at maturity, he is short the autocallable \\ndigitals and long a path-dependent put option. In order to price this structured product, one \\nshould price the autocallable digitals as described above and deduct the price of the path-\\ndependent put option. \\nIn Chapter  10  on barrier options, we analysed in detail the risks associated with down-and-in \\nputs. To brieﬂy summarize, the forward price of the underlying decreases the down-and-in \\nput price. V olatility, skew, and barrier level increase its price. If one is short an autocallable \\nstructure with down-and-in put, he would be short the autocallable digitals and long the put. \\nTherefore, he would deﬁnitely be short the underlying’s forward price and long the triggers \\n(autocallable trigger, coupon trigger and DI put barrier level). However, his overall position in \\nvolatility and skew are not immediately clear owing to potentially offsetting effects from the \\ntwo components. \\nIf the forw ard price is higher than the coupon level, then volatility decreases the price of the \\nautocallable digitals. This is usually the case since the coupon trigger is lower than the initial \\nspot in most of the autocallable structures with a put feature. A trader selling an autocallable is \\nthen usually long volatility with respect to the digitals, and always long volatility with respect \\nto the put. Even if this is generally the case, one should always be cautious and check whether \\nthe Vega of the overall structure is negative. \\nAs for the  skew position, the seller of an autocallable with a put feature has a short skew \\nposition with respect to his short position in digitals, but has also a long skew position with \\nrespect to his long position in the down-and-in put. Then, he needs to check the overall skew \\nposition to know whether he is short or long skew.

The name Twin-\\nWins comes from the fact that this note enables the holder to get a participation in both the \\nupside and the downside movements of the underlying asset. \\nHere, we consider  the example of a 2-year Twin-Wins note, described in Figure 12.5, making \\nsemi-annual payments on observation dates t1, t2, t3 and T . \\nAt each observ ation  date ti (i = 1 ... 3): \\nCoupon( ti ) = 5% × Notional × 1{Ret( i)≥75% }× 1{max j =1,..., i −1(Ret( j ))<105%}\\nThe notional  redemption  can be done at any observation date ti : \\nRedemption(t i ) = Notional × 1{Ret( i )≥105% }× 1{max j =1,..., i −1(Ret( j))<105%}\\nIf the structure has not autocalled, the redemption at maturity is determined as follows: \\n(a) if the underlying closes  at  or above its initial spot, the note is redeemed at: \\n100% + 115%  × [Ret( T ) − 1] \\n(b) if the underlying  closes below its initial spot, but has never closed below the knock-in \\nlevel during the life of the note, the note is redeemed at \\n100% + 55%  × [1 − Ret( T )] \\n(c) if the underlying  closes below its initial spot, and has ever closed below the knock-in level \\nduring the life of the note, the note is converted into physical shares at strike. \\nScenario 1 \\nV\\nodafone’s return  is  higher than 75% (coupon level) but lower than 105% (autocall trigger) \\nat the end of the ﬁrst semester (see scenarios in Figure 12.6). At t1, the investor receives a \\ncoupon of 5% (10% p.a). At t2, the return of V odafone is equal to 113.4%; thus the Twin-Wins \\nautocalls and the investor receives a ﬁnal redemption amount equal to 105% of the notional. 196 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n115% \\n105% \\n95% 85% 75% 65% \\n0 t1 t2\\nt3 T \\nScenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4 \\nFigure 12.6 V odafone return scenarios for the Twin-Wins note described in Figure 12.5. \\nScenario 2 \\nAt the observ ation dates t1, t2 and t3, the autocall trigger has never been breached. V odafone \\nreturns have always been higher than 75%. Therefore, the note holder receives a coupon equal \\nto 5% of the notional at the end of each observation date. At maturity, V odafone’s return \\nis equal to 87% (lower than 100%). Also, the down-and-in put has never been activated. \\nThen the Twin-Wins holder receives 100% of capital protection plus a coupon equal to \\n55% × (100% − 87%) = 7.15% of the notional. \\nScenario 3 \\nIn\\n this case,  the autocall trigger has never been breached at the three observation dates. The \\nthree digitals have been activated and pay the note holder a coupon of 5% at the end of each \\nsemester date. At maturity, the return of V odafone is equal to 109%, which allows the Twin-\\nWins holder to be redeemed at 100% plus a coupon equal to 115% × 9% = 10.35% of the \\nnotional. Scenario 4 \\nThe\\n returns  of  V odafone have always been lower than 105% which means that the Twin-Wins \\nstructure never autocalls. At t1 and t2, the holder receives coupons equal to 5% of the notional. \\nAt t3, the note holder receives no coupon since V odafone’s return is lower than 75%. The put \\nhas been activated during the life of the option. At maturity, the ﬁnal return of V odafone is \\nequal to 80.7%, which is equal to the ﬁnal redemption. In this scenario, the Twin-Wins holder \\nhas lost a part of his capital. \\nTwin-Wins is an  interesting structure in the case where no early redemption has occurred \\nduring the life of the note. Indeed, investors can still capture the absolute performance of the \\nunderlying at maturity if no knock-in event occurred during the life of the product. \\n12.3.3 Autocallables with  Bonus Coupons \\nThe autocallable  with  bonus coupon (ABC) is a non-principal-protected product linked to \\na single asset, and has an early redemption feature. Essentially, the product is an autocall \\nstructure with stepping-down trigger levels, and, in addition, a contingent coupon can be paid \\nat maturity even if the autocall level is not triggered. 197 Autocallable Structures \\nUnderlying asset Citigroup \\nNotional $5,000,000 \\nCurrency USD \\nMaturity 12 months \\nAutocall level 98%, 95%, 92%, 89% \\nAutocall frequency Quarterly \\nCoupon level 98%, 95%, 92%, 89% \\nCoupon frequency Quarterly \\nCoupon value 24% per annum \\nKnock-in level (daily close) 80% \\nDI put strike 100% \\nBonus coupon 20% \\nNote price 100% \\nCapital protected No \\nFigure 12.7 Terms of an autocallable with bonus coupon note based on Citigroup. \\nIn Figure 12.7, we consider an ABC note based on Citigroup’s performance paying quarterly \\ncoupons. Note that the autocall trigger and the coupon trigger are the same; the ABC pays \\nonly one coupon and then autocalls. At each quarterly observation date ti (i = 1, ..., 3): \\nCoupon(t i ) = Notional ×[1 +C(i )] ×1{Ret( i)≥H (i )}×1{Ret(1)< H (1)} \\n×1{Ret(2)< H (2)}···× 1{Ret( i −1)< H (i−1)} \\nwhere C(i ) = (24% ×i )/4 and H (i ) is the trigger level at time ti . At maturity, the redemption \\nis determined as follows: \\n(a) If the underlying  return is greater than or equal to the ﬁnal autocall level (89%), the note \\nis redeemed at: 100% + Autocall coupon; \\n(b) If the ﬁnal  return is below the ﬁnal autocall level, and the underlying has never closed \\nbelow the knock-in level, the note is redeemed at: 100% + Bonus Coupon; \\n(c) If the underlying  closes below its initial spot, and has ever closed below the knock-in level \\nduring the life of the note, the note is converted into physical shares at strike. \\nScenario 1 \\nAt\\n the end  of the ﬁrst quarter, the return of Citigroup is higher than the ﬁrst trigger (see \\nscenarios in Figure 12.8). Then the ABC holder receives a coupon equal to $5,300,000, which \\nis equivalent to 100% plus a coupon of 24%/4 = 6% of the notional. \\nScenario 2 \\nIn\\n the second  scenario, the structure didn’t autocall at the end of the ﬁrst quarter. At t1,n o \\ncoupon is paid. The structure autocalled at t2. The redemption is equal to $5,600,000, which \\nis equivalent to 100% plus a coupon of 24% ×2/4 = 12% of the notional. /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg 198 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n110% \\n100% \\n90% 80% 70% \\n0 t1 t2\\nt3 T \\nScenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4 \\nFigure 12.8 Citigroup return scenarios for the ABC note described in Figure 12.7. \\nScenario 3 \\nIn this case,  the autocall trigger has never been breached at the three observation dates. The \\nthree digitals have never been activated and the note holder receives no coupon at the end of \\nthe observation dates. The knock-in barrier is daily monitored and has never been activated. \\nAt maturity, the return of Citigroup is equal to 84.25%, which is lower than the last coupon \\ntrigger. Therefore, the note holder receives 100% of the notional plus the bonus coupon equal \\nto 20% of the notional. \\nScenario 4 \\nThe\\n returns  of  Citigroup have always been lower than the coupon triggers which means that \\nthe ABC structure never autocalls. The knock-in barrier has been activated. The note holder is \\nthen long an at-the-money put at maturity. No coupons are paid during the life of the option. \\nThe ﬁnal return of Citigroup is equal to 86%, which is equal to the ﬁnal redemption. This is a \\ngood example where the capital is not protected. \\n12.4 MULTI-ASSET AUTOCALLABLES \\n12.4.1 Worst-of Autocallables \\nPayoff Description  \\nAssume\\n that we  start with a basket composed of n assets S1, S2,..., Sn then a worst-of \\nautocallable note based on this basket has the following payoff. \\nAt each observ ation  date ti : \\nCoupon( ti ) = Notional × C × 1{WRet(t i )≥B}× 1{(max j =1,..., i −1(WRet(t j )))<H } \\nH and B  are respectively the autocall and coupon triggers. \\nSk (ti )WRet(t i ) = min \\nk=1,...,n Sk (0) 199 Autocallable Structures \\nUnderlying assets KBC, ING, FORTIS, DEXIA \\nNotional £10 million \\nCurrency GBP \\nMaturity 3 years \\nAutocall level 100% \\nAutocall frequency Annual \\nCoupon level 60% \\nCoupon frequency Annual \\nCoupon value 25% per annum \\nNote price 98% \\nCapital protected Ye s \\nFigure 12.9 The terms of a 3-year worst-of autocallable note. \\nSince the wrapper is a note, the holder receives back 100% of the notional whenever the \\nproduct autocalls. Otherwise, the notional is paid at maturity. \\nRedemption(t i ) = Notional × 1{WRet(t i )≥H }× 1{(max j =1,..., i −1(WRet(t j )))<H } \\nLet’s clarify  the  payoff mechanism by creating some scenarios on a speciﬁc case to be more \\nfamiliar with the behaviour of the worst-of autocallable structure. \\nLet’s take the  example of a Belgian investor who wants to invest in the bank sector in \\nMarch 2009. Most of the banks suffered from the crisis and their shares dropped signiﬁcantly. \\nThe Belgian investor believes that these banks will recover their losses in the next 3 years. \\nHe decides to invest £10 million in a worst-of autocallable on four banks from Belgium and \\nNetherlands. After calling the sales and structuring team of an investment bank, he has been \\noffered the product shown in Figure 12.9, based on a basket composed of KBC, ING, Fortis \\nand Dexia. In the scenario presented in Figure 12.10, the note holder receives annual coupons \\nbased on the performance of the worst performing stock. At the end of the ﬁrst year, all the \\nstocks’ performances are above 60% but the worst performing stock is below 100%. Therefore, \\nthe ﬁrst coupon is equal to 25% of the notional and the structure doesn’t autocall. At the end \\nof year 2, the product doesn’t autocall since there is at least one stock performance below \\n100%, which is the autocall trigger. However, the worst performance is above 60% (coupon \\ntrigger), which makes the second coupon equal to 25%. At maturity, one of the stocks shows \\n0 T 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% \\nt1 t 2 110% \\nFigure 12.10 Scenario of returns for the underlying stocks of the worst-of autocallable note described \\nin Figure 12.9. 200 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\na performance lower than 60%. Then, there is no variable coupon at the end of the third year. \\nThe note holder receives 100% of the notional at this last observation date. \\nRisk Analysis In order  to\\n  price the worst-of autocallable digitals efﬁciently, one can compute the undiscounted \\nconditional probabilities of receiving the coupons. These values enable us to quickly check \\nwhether our pricing makes sense. After computing these probabilities, one should discount \\nthem and multiply them by the coupons to be received. This gives us the price of the autocallable \\ndigitals on the worst performing stock. \\nAs is the  case for single asset autocallables, the probabilities of coupons being paid decrease \\nwith time and the value of the last path-dependent digitals can be quite small because the \\nconditional probabilities of striking would be low. In this case, one must be careful when \\noffering a very large digital with a low probability – the teeny effect. \\nA worst-of autocallable  note contains a series of path-dependent worst-of digitals. The \\nrisks associated with a worst-of autocall are the same as those associated with worst-of \\ndigitals which we discussed in Chapter 11. The seller of worst-of autocallables is short the \\nunderlying’s forwards and will need to buy Delta in each of the underlying assets on day 1, \\nand adjust dynamically through the life of the trade to remain Delta neutral. The seller is short \\nthe skew, long the coupon trigger, long volatility and short correlation. \\n12.4.2 Snowball Effect  and Worst-of put Feature \\nPayoff Description  \\nWhere\\n the coupon  trigger is equal to the autocall trigger, the autocallable structure dies \\nimmediately after the coupon is paid. In other words, only one coupon is paid. We can modify \\nthe coupon payments by creating snowballing coupons. If the product is still alive at year i , \\nthis means that the investor didn’t receive the previous periodic coupons. The snowballing \\nstructure enables the investor to receive a coupon equal to the sum of all previous coupons \\nif the trigger is reached. The investor is then recovering his losses due to the non-received \\nprevious coupons. \\nOne can also  add a worst-of down-and-in put feature to the autocallable structure. This \\nhappens when the investor is willing to increase the potential coupons received and he believes \\nthat all the shares composing the underlying basket will perform above a speciﬁc level. This \\nmeans that the capital is no longer protected as the investor is short a put option at maturity. \\nAs is the  case for autocalls on a single asset, the put option can also be a vanilla European \\nput on the underlying basket, with expiry date equal to the maturity of the autocall. Here we \\nare going to consider the case where the investor is short a worst-of down-and-in at-the-money \\nput with European barrier, which means that the knock-in event is determined at maturity only. \\nAssume that we  start with a basket composed of n assets S1, S2,..., Sn , then a worst-of \\nautocallable note based on this basket has the following payoff: \\nAt each observ ation  date ti : \\nCoupon( ti ) = Notional × [1 + i × C] × 1{WRet(t i )≥H }× 1{(max j =1,..., i −1(WRet(t j )))<H } 201 Autocallable Structures \\nUnderlying assets KBC, ING, FORTIS, DEXIA \\nNotional £10 million \\nCurrency GBP \\nMaturity 3 years \\nAutocall level 100% \\nAutocall frequency Annual \\nCoupon level 100% \\nCoupon frequency Annual \\nCoupon value 10%, 20%, 30% \\nKnock-in level 60% \\nDI put strike 100% \\nNote price 99% \\nCapital protected No \\nFigure 12.11 The terms of a 3-year worst-of autocallable note with worst-of down-and-in put at \\nmaturity. \\nIf the structure has not autocalled, the redemption at maturity is determined as follows: \\n(a) If all the  assets composing the underlying basket close at or above the knock-in level, the \\nnote is redeemed at 100%; \\n(b) If one of  the underlyings closes below the knock-in level, the note is converted into physical \\nshares at strike. \\nFigure 12.11  sho ws an example of a contract on a worst-of autocallable structure with snow-\\nballing coupons  and  a worst-of down-and-in put feature at maturity. \\nRisk Analysis When we sell\\n  a worst-of autocall with a put feature at maturity, we are short the worst-\\nof autocallable digitals and long a path-dependent worst-of put option. In order to price \\nthe worst-of autocallable digitals efﬁciently, one can compute the price of the autocallable \\ndigitals separately, as mentioned in section 12.2, and deduct the price of the worst-of put. The \\nprobabilities of coupons being paid decrease with time and can be quite small for the last \\npath-dependent digitals. Also note that in the case of snowballing coupons, the digital size \\nincreases with time since the potential coupons are higher. Therefore, one must be careful \\nwhen offering a very large digital with a very low probability of striking (low price compared \\nto the high potential loss). \\nA worst-of autocallable  note with a worst-of down-and-in put is composed of zero coupon \\nbonds, worst-of autocallable digitals and a worst-of down-and-in put. Now that we are familiar \\nwith these structures, we can easily analyse the risks associated with a worst-of autocall with \\nsnowballing coupons and worst-of down-and-in put. If one is short this structure, he is short \\nthe worst-of autocall and long the worst-of put. \\nRemember, being  short  the worst-of autocall implies being short the underlying’s forwards \\nand long the coupon trigger (which is equal to the autocall trigger in this case). Also, the \\ntrader selling these options is long volatility and short correlation. In Chapter 10, we discussed \\nthe risks associated with worst-of down-and-in puts. To brieﬂy summarize: the forward price 202 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nof the underlyings decreases the down-and-in put price; volatility, skew, and knock-in barrier \\nlevel increase its price; correlation between the underlying assets decreases its price; therefore, \\none buying a worst-of down-and-in put is short the forwards, long the knock-in barrier, long \\nthe volatility, short the correlation and long the skew. \\nIf one is  short a worst-of autocallable structure with snowball effect and worst-of down-and-\\nin put, he would deﬁnitely be short the forward prices, long the triggers (autocallable trigger, \\ncoupon trigger and DI put barrier level), long volatility and short correlation. \\nThe position  in  skew is more complex to determine since the skew makes the sold worst-of \\ndigitals more expensive but also makes the bought worst-of down-and-in put more expensive. \\nEven if the short skew position in digitals has usually more effect on the price than the long \\nskew position in the put at maturity, it is not always the case. Then, we need to be careful \\nand price both skew effects with 100% skew to determine whether we have an overall bid or \\noffer with respect to the skew. After this has been done, we reprice the worst-of autocall with \\ndown-and-in put at maturity by applying the correct parameter on skew. \\n12.4.3 Outperformance Autocallables  \\nLet’s consider  tw o assets S1 and S2. An outperformance autocall based on the outperformance \\nof S1 vs S2 is typically a European style option that pays a coupon C at each observation date \\nif S1 − S2 outperforms a speciﬁc level called a cushion . This outperformance structure has an \\nautocall feature that pays a coupon upon early redemption. This note payoff is as follows: \\nAt each observ ation  date ti : \\nCoupon( ti ) = Notional × [1 + i × C] × 1{Ret 1(ti )−Ret 2(ti )≥Cushion } \\n×1{max j =1,..., i −1(Ret 1(ti )−Ret 2(ti ))<Cushion}\\nwhere Ret i (t ) = Si (t )/Si (0). \\nOutperformance autocallable  options  are composed of path-dependent outperformance dig-\\nitals. Indeed,  the  ﬁrst digital is a usual outperformance one with a maturity equal to the ﬁrst \\nobservation date. The digitals exist only if all the previous ones didn’t strike. There is one and \\nonly one coupon payment that also corresponds to the autocall event. \\nNow, let’s tak e the example of an English investor who believes that HSBC bank will \\nsuffer more losses compared to the banking sector in Asia. Most of the analysts agree that for \\nthe next 2 years there is a low probability that HSBC will outperform the Hang Seng bank \\nindex by more than 35%. Therefore, the investor decides to buy the structure presented in \\nFigure 12.12. Note that, in this case, the autocall trigger is equal to the coupon level, and \\nUnderlying assets Hang Seng Bank vs HSBC \\nNotional £20 million \\nCurrency GBP \\nMaturity 24 months \\nCushion –35% \\nAutocall frequency Semi-Annual \\nCoupon value (snowballing) 20% per annum \\nNote price 100% \\nCapital protected Ye s \\nFigure 12.12 The terms of a 2-year outperformance autocallable note. 203 Autocallable Structures \\nthe coupons are snowballing. At the end of each semi-annual observation i , if the difference \\nbetween the Hang Seng bank index performance and HSBC performance is greater than or \\nequal to the cushion, the note is redeemed at 100% + C(i ), where C(i ) = i × 20%/2. At \\nmaturity, the holder receives 100% of the notional invested if HSBC has always outperformed \\nthe banking index by more than 35% at the different observation dates. \\nOne should  be  cautious when pricing and hedging outperformance autocallables since they \\ninvolve trading outperformance digitals. The risks associated with these structures are quite \\nsimilar and have been fully covered in Chapter 11. The cushion is important in the risk \\nmanagement process of trading this structure. In the case of the cushion being negative, the \\noutperformance digitals are in-the-money. Otherwise, they are out-of-the-money. Also note \\nthat the cushion was implicitly equal to zero when we previously described outperformance \\ndigitals.

They are appealing \\nretail products because they provide downside protection while at the same time offer sig-\\nniﬁcant upside  potential.  Cliquet structures are most popular on single indices, but are also \\nstructured on stocks, and even baskets of stocks or indices. By introducing various caps and \\nﬂoors, local and global, one is sure to ﬁnd an attractive yet reasonably priced derivative. \\nCliquets are also  known as ratchet options because they are based on resetting the strike of \\na derivative structure to the last ﬁxing of the underlying asset. The resetting feature is what \\nmakes cliquets unique from the payoffs we have covered so far. This resetting introduces what \\nis known as forward skew exposure, as mentioned in Chapter 4. These are truly beautiful \\nderivatives but must be handled with caution. \\nThis chapter  introduces  cliquets and we look at various versions with different caps and \\nﬂoors, and reverse cliquets. The discussion of cliquets is not possible without going into slightly \\nmore detail regarding models than we previously presented. This is due to the additional risks \\nthat these products hold. The goal is to explain these without making the discussion too \\ntechnical. \\nIn the literature,  cliquets are discussed in articles including Bergomi (2004) who presents \\na new model for cliquets, Jeffery (2004) who discusses reverse cliquets, and Wilmott (2002) \\nwho discusses cliquets and volatility models. Cliquets also appear in Gatheral (2006) and \\nOverhaus et al. (2007). \\n13.1 FORW ARD STARTING OPTIONS \\nA forward starting option is an option that starts at some (prespeciﬁed) time in the future (we \\ncall this the strike date), and has a maturity after that date. Since the option starts in the future, \\nwe cannot know (today) the price of the underlying at this starting point in the future, and for \\nthis reason it is standard to specify a strike price as a percentage of moneyness. For example, \\nwe can set the strike to be 100% of the price of the underlying at the strike date, so that the \\noption starts ATM. Forward starting options are typically traded on ﬁxed dollar notionals, not \\nnumbers of shares. Let’s explain this through a payoff. A forward starting call has payoff \\nForward Starting  Call payoff = max 0, St2 − kS t1 \\nor in percentage returns \\nSt2Forward Starting Call payoff = max 0, − K St1 \\nwhere t0 < t1 < t2.H e r e t0 is the inception date, on which the premium is paid. t1 is as \\ndescribed above the strike date, or the date on which the option’s strike becomes set. The 208 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nTable 13.1 Strik es  for forward starting calls, and the position in which the \\noptions start. \\nCall option Put option \\nK < 100%  Starts (1 − K  )% ITM Starts (1 − K  )% OTM \\nK > 100%  Starts (K −  1)% OTM Starts (K −  1)% ITM \\nK = 100%  Starts ATM Starts ATM \\noption, however, is priced and the premium is ﬁxed and paid at t0.I f t0 = t1 this reduces to a \\nstandard call option on S. \\nThis is stating  that on t0 the investor pays for an option that will not strike until t1.W h y i s \\nthis useful to an investor? From the investors’ points of view, a forward starting option can \\nbe used if they want exposure to the underlying at the future point t1 going forward, but not \\nbetween t0 and t1. By buying (or selling) a forward starting option at t0 they pay (or receive) a \\nﬁxed price for an option that has a strike contingent on the underlying’s level at a future date, \\nwhether to hedge or to speculate. \\nIt is true  that one can apply a Black–Scholes formula to price such an option, but caution \\nmust be taken. The question to be asked here is which volatility does one use to price a forward \\nstarting option? We know the implied volatilities of vanilla options, but what about forward \\nstarting options? The answer is that one must use the implied forward volatility, and this may \\nnot be available with the same liquidity we see in regular vanillas. Ideally at time t0 we would \\nlike to have surfaces for all strikes, strike dates t1 and maturities t2, but this does not exist. If it \\ndid we would know the prices of all forward starting calls and puts. How about OTM and ITM \\noptions? Much like the existence of the skew we see in vanilla options’ implied volatilities \\nacross strikes, we have what is known as a forward skew. Buying or selling forward starting \\ncalls or puts gives the investor exposure to this forward skew. Let us take the example of a \\ncall spread, only now we look at a forward starting call spread (Table 13.1). Consider the \\ncase of an ATM-15% call spread, where the strikes are now represented in terms of returns, \\nnot performance. The seller of this call spread is essentially selling the ATM forward starting \\ncall and buying the 15% forward starting OTM call (just like the usual call spread of Chapter \\n6). In the above payoff formula for the forward starting call, the ATM call has K = 0% and \\nthe OTM call has K = 15%. As we shall see, the simplest of cliquet products are built as \\njust a series of forward starting calls, that is, a series of forward starting calls with the same \\ninitial date t0, but where the strike date of the second (or the j th) call is the maturity date of \\nthe ﬁrst (or ( j − 1)th) call. Not all hope is lost in regard to getting the right forward skews \\nas there exist standardized cliquets for which one can obtain some market consensus data \\nfrom which one can extrapolate a fairly accurate idea of where the market is pricing forward \\nskew. \\n13.2 CLIQUETS WITH LOCAL FLOORS AND CAPS \\nSo, now that we know what a forward starting call is, let’s look at a sum of forward starting \\ncalls and build what is known as a cliquet structure. /summationdisplay /bracketleftbigg /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg 209 The Cliquet Family \\n13.2.1 Payoff Mechanism \\nLet’\\ns start with  the example of a cliquet, which has a local ﬂoor and a local cap (called an \\nLFLC Cliquet for brevity). \\nn \\nLFLC Cliquet payoff = max F,min Sti −1,C Sti −1i =1 \\nwhere the term (Sti /Sti −1 −1) is the i th periodic return, C is the local cap and F is the local \\nﬂoor. We call this a symmetric cliquet when F =− C, that is, the cap and ﬂoor are symmetric \\naround zero. \\nNotice that the  denominator of Sti /Sti −1 is Sti −1 (the previous period’s return) not S0 (the \\ninitial value). These are what we refer to as cliquet style returns. The set of dates t0,t1,..., tn \\nare the initial date t0 and the n reset dates t1,..., tn . We call each of the time intervals [ti−1,ti ] \\na period, and the returns are also known as period returns or period to period returns . \\nFollowing the abo ve deﬁnition of a forward starting call option, this is just a sum of such \\nforward starting call options. To be exact, it is in fact the sum of forward starting call spreads. \\nSetting the ﬂoor F =0 the holder of the cliquet is long the ATM forward starting calls and \\nshort the forward starting OTM calls of strike C (the local cap), each with maturity equal to \\nthe resetting period. \\nTable 13.2 describes  the cliquet payoff. In each scenario, there are three yearly returns: \\ninitial date to year 1, year 1 to year 2, year 2 to year 3. The call option column gives the payoff \\nof a 3-year regular European call option, and the cliquet is the sum of the capped/ﬂoored \\nannual returns. In scenario 1, there is no difference between the two, in the second we notice \\nthat the cliquet does not pick up the negative return of year 2, and the overall payoff is higher \\nthan that of the call. In the third the cliquet does not pick up the ﬁrst 2 years of negative returns \\nand has non-zero payoff whereas the ATM call ends worthless out of the money. \\nWe have seen  that ﬂooring the annual returns in the cliquet has saved us from potentially \\nbad returns that eat away at the call option. In scenario 4 things start to change, and we see the \\neffect of the cap. Here the cliquet has not picked up the negative return in year 1 but has the \\nsigniﬁcant return of year 3 capped at 10% (the local cap is set at 10%), and the call ends up in \\nthe money with a payoff greater than the cliquet. The last scenario clearly tells the story of the \\nlocal cap. With no negative returns in any year, the call will end in the money (possibly ATM \\nif all are zero), but while the call becomes more and more in-the-money, the cliquet picks up \\nthese positive returns only capped. The end result is that the call has a higher payoff. \\nTable 13.2 Scenario observations of the index performances on the 3 years. Note, each return now \\nrepresents the return for the speciﬁc year only, not from the initial date. That is, for example the second \\ncolumn (year 2) represents the returns between the end of year 1 and the end of year 2. The call option \\nis computed from the initial date to the ﬁnal date (end of year 3) as a comparison. The cliquet has a \\nlocal ﬂoor of 0% and local cap at 10%, the call is ATM. \\nYear 1 Y ear 2 Y ear 3 3-Y ear ATM call LFLC  cliquet \\nScenario\\n 1 0%  0% 5% 5% 5% \\nScenario 2 0%  −2% 5% 2.9% 5% \\nScenario 3 − 6% −5% 10% 0% 10% \\nScenario 4 − 2% 5% 13% 16.28% 15% \\nScenario 5 5%  11% 16% 35.2% 25% /bracketleftBigg /parenleftBigg /parenrightBigg/bracketrightBigg /summationdisplay /parenleftbig /parenleftbig /parenrightbig/parenrightbig 210 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nAs we can see, the returns are annual from one year to the next, and so to ﬁnd the return \\nfrom start to ﬁnish (for the ATM call) we use the following formula: \\nRet call = (1 + Ret year 1)(1 + Ret year 2)(1 + Ret year 3) − 1 \\nIn conclusion  so  far, the locally ﬂoored cliquet allows the investor to pick up positive annual \\nreturns and lock in such proﬁt (we are assuming accrued returns are paid at maturity, although \\nthey can be paid annually). This will ﬁt quite naturally into a note structure with capital \\nguarantee, an easily marketable retail product: you collect all positive annual returns capped \\nat 10% but none of the negative returns, and of course your money back at maturity. \\n13.2.2 Forward Skew  and Other Risks \\nA key risk  here that we did not see in previous chapters is the cliquet’s exposure to forward \\nskew. Much the same way as a normal call spread has skew exposure, a forward starting call \\nspread has exposure to forward skew, as we saw in the previous section. Cliquet structures \\nhave caps and ﬂoors, which immediately implies skew dependency. Because cliquets are a \\nseries of skew-dependent options, the overall structure will itself be quite skew sensitive, and \\ndue to the reset features it is forward skew to which the cliquet is exposed. \\nIn fact, there  is exposure to more than one forward skew; taking the example in Table 13.2, \\nthe ﬁrst call spread has exposure to the usual skew, the volatility skew given by the vanilla \\noptions surface taken at the required strikes. The second call spread is sensitive to the 1- to \\n2-year forward skew, and, likewise, the third is sensitive to the 2- to 3-year skew. Obviously, \\nan increase in any of these will increase the price of the cliquet, so the seller of the derivative \\nis short forward skew. \\nMany of the  derivatives we have seen so far can, with some caution, be evaluated using \\nlocal volatility models. Let us assume that we have calibrated a local volatility model to a set \\nof vanilla options. If we were to simulate the process forward in time, we ﬁnd that the forward \\nskews it generates begin to ﬂatten out. This can be explained by the fact that, in local volatility \\nmodels, the volatility is a deterministic function of the underlying price. This dependency \\nof the volatility on the spot results in higher probabilities of the spot moving higher, so as \\ntime goes by (or as we simulate forward in time), we ﬁnd that volatilities and skew go down \\n(thus the ﬂattening out effect). This is cause for serious concern as anyone attempting to price \\ncliquets or any forward skew-dependent derivative with local volatility will almost surely \\nmisprice it. \\n13.3 CLIQUETS WITH GLOBAL FLOORS AND CAPS \\nNow we introduce global ﬂoors and caps to the cliquets we saw in the previous section. The \\nglobally ﬂoored and globally capped cliquet has the following payoff: \\nn \\nGFGC Cliquet payoff = max GF, min GC, max F, min Ret ti , C \\ni =1 /bracketleftBigg /bracketrightBigg /summationdisplay /parenleftbig /parenrightbig \\n/parenleftbig /parenrightbig /parenleftbig /parenrightbig 211 The Cliquet Family \\nwhere the term Ret ti =(Sti /Sti −1) −1i st h e i th periodic return, C is the local cap and F is the \\nlocal ﬂoor, GC and GF are the global cap and ﬂoor respectively. The above payoff is the same \\nlocally ﬂoored and capped cliquet we saw above, only the total sum of all the cliquets is now \\ncapped and ﬂoored (that is, globally capped and ﬂoored). \\nThe ﬁrst thing  to note is that, in the case of a local ﬂoor F set to zero, a global ﬂoor of zero \\n(or less than zero) is meaningless as the payoff will be non-negative (a sum of returns each \\nﬂoored at zero). Introducing a positive global ﬂoor of, for example, 1% will act as a minimum \\nguarantee for the option, guaranteeing a non-zero payoff of at least 1%, but as previously \\nshown, this makes the option more expensive. \\nTwo popular cliquets  are  the locally ﬂoored globally capped cliquet and the locally capped \\nand globally ﬂoored cliquet. With the ﬁrst, the local ﬂoor can be set so that the investor receives \\nno returns below this ﬂoor F and the global cap GC serves as a means to make the derivative \\ncheaper than the uncapped version. \\nConsider, for e xample, that we are structuring a note, along the lines of the structuring \\nprocess described in section 3.10. We also have a certain amount to spend on the option after \\nsecuring the return of 100% capital through a zero coupon bond, and we can set the ﬂoor at the \\nrequired level, for example at 0% and then solve for the global cap that makes the derivative \\nprice exactly right to ﬁt into the note structure. The payoff here is a special case of the above \\ngeneral formula (here we have no local cap or global ﬂoor) \\nn \\nLFGC Cliquet payoff =min GC, max F, Ret ti \\ni =1 \\nHowever, one can use the general formula and think of the local cap and global ﬂoor to be \\nexistent, but set to unreachable levels (for example, C =10, 000% and GF =−10, 000%), \\nthis might be applied if one has only a generic pricing template for pricing cliquets and needs \\nto specify these two values. One thing to note is that we must enforce the restriction that n ×F \\nmust be strictly less than GC, or else the payoff makes no sense as it will always be equal \\nto GC. Fo r w a rd Sk ew R\\n i s k \\nAgain we need  to see the forward skew exposure. This cliquet is a nice example involving \\nmaximums and minimums for which we can show some manipulations for complex payoff as \\nsuch. If one looks inside the payoff of the LFGC cliquet above, the term inside the sum can \\nbe written as \\nmax F, Ret ti =max 0, Ret ti −F +F \\nwhich is nothing  but a call (for each i ), plus a minimum guarantee of F. How far in- or \\nout-of-the-money the calls are clearly depends on the level of the ﬂoor F . Next we manipulate /bracketleftBigg /bracketrightBigg /summationdisplay /parenleftbig /parenrightbig \\n/summationdisplay /summationdisplay /bracketleftBigg /bracketrightBigg \\n/parenleftbig /parenrightbig /parenleftbig /parenrightbig \\n/summationdisplay /summationdisplay /bracketleftBigg /bracketrightBigg \\n/parenleftbig /parenrightbig /parenleftbig /parenrightbig \\n/summationdisplay /parenleftbig /parenrightbig \\n/bracketleftBigg /bracketrightBigg /summationdisplay /parenleftbig /parenrightbig 212 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nthe overall payoff as follows: \\nn \\nLFGC Cliquet payoff = min GC, max F, Ret ti \\ni=1 \\nn n \\n= GC + max F, Ret ti − max GC, max F, Ret ti \\ni=1 i =1 \\nn n \\n= max F, Ret ti − max 0, max F, Ret ti − GC \\ni=1 i =1 \\nn \\n= nF + max 0, Ret ti − F \\ni=1 \\nn \\n− max 0, max 0, Ret ti − F − (GC − nF) (13.1) \\ni =1 \\nThe ﬁrst equality is just the payoff deﬁnition; the second equality makes use of the identity \\nmin( A, B) + max( A, B) = A + B; and in the third we have taken the term GC outside of the \\nlast term and it cancels with the ﬁrst term. In the last equality we have used the derivation \\ndone above and removed the ﬂoor from the payoffs of the ﬂoored call so that we can see each \\nas a call struck at F . Since GC −nF > 0, the second term of equation (13.1) minus the third \\nterm is always positive. The term nF appearing here is just n (the number of periods) times F \\nwhich makes perfect sense in the last equality as from the payoff deﬁnition we can directly see \\nthat the option will have to pay at least as much as the sum of all the ﬂoors, which is n × F . \\nHaving split the  payoff as such we can now see two clear things. The second term is just \\na series of forward starting call options. The third term is a compound option (an option on \\nan option) and here it is an OTM call on a series of forward starting call options. It is OTM \\nbecause we have the constraint that GC−nF > 0 in order that the initial payoff of this cliquet \\nmakes sense. Splitting the payoff as such will allow us to see the existence of the two key \\ncliquet risks separately. \\nThe ﬁrst ef fect to consider is Vega; the second term is a call option and thus obviously \\nhas positive Vega; and the third term, although a compound option, also has positive Vega. \\nIf volatility goes up, both of these increase in value. However, since these two have different \\nsigns it is not clear which has the greater effect to determine the volatility position. This is \\ncompounded by the fact that we do not have a prespeciﬁed value for F, different values of F \\nset the ﬁrst set of call options at different levels of moneyness, which also impacts their Vega \\nsensitivity. Recall from the discussion on Vega in Chapter 5 than an ATM call option has a \\nhigher Vega than ITM and OTM call options. This effect is also not clear cut on the compound \\noption. \\nThe appearance  of  the second term, which involves the sum of forward starting call options, \\nwill have forward skew exposure. Whether this is a cost or a beneﬁt is not clear until one \\nspeciﬁes the value of F . The reason is that if F is negative, then the call options are ITM, and \\nin the presence of skew this increases the ITM call option volatility, in this case forward skew, \\nthus raising their prices. However, if F is positive, the opposite occurs as these calls will be \\nOTM and the OTM vol is lower in the presence of skew. The third term will also have forward \\nskew exposure, but likewise the position is not clear. It is also the fact that the call options are \\nembedded into another call option in the third term that means the forward skew risk cannot /summationdisplay \\n/bracketleftBigg /bracketrightBigg /summationdisplay 213 The Cliquet Family \\nbe captured solely by using the forward implied volatility at the correct strike, and here we \\nmust apply a model that knows about forward skew. \\nAnother risk to  be aware of here is Vega convexity. It comes primarily from the third term \\nand is due to the nature of any compound option. The meaning and interpretations of this risk \\nare discussed below once we have introduced the second cliquet in this family. \\nLooking at the  second structure – the cliquet with local caps and a global ﬂoor – do we \\nsee anything familiar? This structure is similar to the ICBC structure of Chapter 9, but here \\ninstead of having one time period and the returns of several assets, each locally capped, we \\nnow have only one asset but a set of returns (due to the resetting). To explain further, let \\nRet i , i = 1,..., n be the returns for each of the n periods respectively, then the payoff is \\ngiven by \\n/bracketleftBigg\\n /bracketrightBigg n \\nGFLC Cliquet payoff = max GF , min (Ret i ,C) \\ni =1 \\nwhich resembles the payoff of the ICBC (here returns are taken through time, not over a basket \\nof underlyers). As we saw with the ICBC, the method of using local caps and global ﬂoors is \\nan effective method of reducing the price of such a derivative. Here the local caps limit the \\nupside returns, and the global ﬂoor acts as a guarantee against a negative overall payout. \\nLet us consider  such a cliquet with a 2-year maturity where returns are computed on a \\nquarterly basis. Specifying the global ﬂoor at 0% and the local cap at 5%, we have the \\nfollowing payoff: \\n8 \\nGFLC Cliquet payoff = max 0 , min (Ret i ,5%) \\ni =1 \\nfor which we consider a set of scenarios in Table 13.3 which are analysed as follows. In the \\nﬁrst scenario the local cap of 5% caps the positive return in Q3 but all the negative returns are \\npicked up. In the second scenario it is clear that the index has performed relatively well, and \\nthe cliquet returns 18%. \\nIn this case,  an analysis similar to that above will show that the seller of the option is buying \\nvolatility and selling forward skew. We now turn our attention to Vega convexity. \\n13.3.1 Vega Con vexity \\nIn\\n addition  to  the forward skew exposure, we have also to worry about Vega convexity. Just \\nto settle the forward skew risk, all we have to do is note that at each interval [ti −1,ti ] between \\neach two reset dates ti−1 and ti we are capping the returns, that is, the seller of the option is \\nbuying volatility at each of these caps. Much like the ICBC, the seller of the option is selling \\nTable 13.3 Scenario observations of the index performances of the eight quarterly returns for the \\n2-year globally-ﬂoored locally-capped cliquet. The global ﬂoor is set to zero and the local cap set to 5%. \\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q8 GFLC \\nScenario 1 0%  2% 7% 3% −3% 0% −3.5% 1% 4.5% \\nScenario 2 2%  3% 2% −1% 2% 6% 4% 1% 18% \\nScenario 3 − 1% −4% −2% 0.5% −3% 1% 2% 0% 0% 214 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nskew, only here, due to the reset feature, it is the forward skew of the period [ti −1, ti ] to which \\nthe seller is exposed. \\nOnto Vega con vexity, we have touched on the existence of this, but let’s look at the details, \\nasking the questions: What is Vega convexity? Or convexity in general ﬁrstly? As we saw \\nin the case of vanilla options written on an underlying asset S, the option price is sensitive \\nto movements in said underlying. Not just ﬁrst order however, we have Delta and Gamma, \\nthat is, as the underlying moves our Delta changes. This makes perfect sense as we saw in \\nChapter 5 on the Greek letters, that, for example, as a call option moves further into the money \\n(i.e. the underlying  has  increased in price) our Delta increases. Thus the second-order effect, \\nthe Gamma – or, as one might call this, the convexity. That is, a call option is convex in the \\nunderlying (this is clear from the payoff of a call plotted against S) and convexity is in fact \\nwhat gives the call options value. \\nThis general  term  convexity,o r price convexity , is often used to refer to the second-order \\neffect, Gamma. We now want to understand Vega convexity. We know Vega is the sensitivity of \\nour option price to a movement in the volatility of the underlying. Vega convexity, also known \\nas V olga, is the second-order sensitivity, or convexity, of our option price to a movement in \\nthe underlying’s volatility. Mathematically it is the second derivative of the option price w.r.t \\nvolatility. Under Black–Scholes, the Vega of a call (and a put) is given by \\n√ −qT /Phi1/prime(d1) V = S  e T \\nNow let’s turn  our attention to the second-order effect of a change in vol. Under Black– \\nScholes, the V olga of a call (also a put) option is given by \\nd1d2 −qT /Phi1/prime(d1) √ d1d2Vo l ga = S e T = V σσ \\nAs we can  see in Figure 13.1, the ATM call has no Vega convexity. If we go back to the \\napproximations in Chapter 5, section 5.9, the formula for approximating the price of the ATM \\n2.5 \\n2 \\n1.5 \\n1 \\n0.5 \\n0 \\n0% 50% 100% 150% 200%  \\nFigure 13.1 V olga of a call option (also for a put option), over strike. Note that the ATM call has no \\nV olga, whereas the OTM and ITM calls pick up V olga but then the very deep OTM and ITM calls lose \\ntheir Vega convexity. 215 The Cliquet Family \\ncall is built on the fact that the price is approximately linear in volatility. That is, its Vega is \\nconstant and not a function of the level of volatility. So the second derivative w.r.t. volatility \\nmust be approximately zero. \\nAs we mo ve away from the money, the OTM and ITM calls start to pick up convexity; \\nhowever, if we go sufﬁciently deep in- or out-of-the-money, we see that convexity fades to \\nzero. In these cases the moneyness of the options is so extreme that in the OTM call it drives \\nthe price down towards zero, rendering sensitivities negligible, and in the case of the deep \\nITM call, the price becomes linear in the underlying and has thus lost its convexities. \\nNow given that  we know the prices of call options from the market, we do not need to worry \\nabout this when pricing them. In fact we know the implied volatility of these options, which \\nare the values we plug into Black–Scholes to obtain a price. Obviously these are driven by \\nsupply and demand, and these convexities are already priced into the call option values. \\nHowever, our belo ved cliquets do have Vega convexity that will need to be priced. Much \\nthe same way that one assumes an underlying stock price to be a stochastic (random) process \\nin order to price options, we will need to introduce the concept of stochastic volatility here. \\nWhy? When we model a stock price as a random process it allows us to see the convexity \\nto this stock price (Gamma); if we had assumed it to be deterministic (no randomness in the \\nstock price) our option would have no value (as we would not see the convexity). The same \\nthing applies in the case of Vega convex options, only here we need to allow our volatility (or \\npossibly the variance) to be a random process of its own to enable us to see Vega convexity. \\nFor a technical explanation of this, see section A.3 of Appendix A. \\nLocal volatility models  do not work in Vega convex situations because the volatility is \\nassumed to be a deterministic function of the underlying’s price, thus not a random process of \\nits own. So a local volatility process does not know about Vega convexity, and it will thus not \\nshow us such risk when used to price Vega convex payouts. One must be cautious. Obviously \\nthe case of Black–Scholes, where volatility is just a constant, is effectively a special case of \\nlocal volatility and is no use in these situations. \\nUsing a stochastic  volatility model for such product allows us to look at a vol-of-vol \\nparameter (the volatility of volatility). Recall, for the volatility to be itself a random process, \\nit must have its own volatility which is known as vol-of-vol. This term is the coefﬁcient of the \\nsecond derivative w.r.t. volatility (V olga) in a pricing equation. \\n13.3.2 Levels of These  Risks \\nSo now we  are faced with two risks: forward skew and Vega convexity. These are present \\nin the cliquets we have seen so far and all the others to come in this chapter. The degree of \\nsensitivity to each of these differs however from one product to the next. Understanding this \\nis the key to pricing these structures correctly. \\nStarting with the  locally ﬂoored and capped cliquet, with no global ﬂoors or caps, we look \\nat the special case of a symmetric cliquet. From section 13.2.1, this means that the local cap \\nand the local ﬂoor are equidistant from the ATM point but on opposite sides; for example, a \\ncliquet with a local ﬂoor of −10% and local cap of +10%. What is special about this cliquet is \\nthat at the ATM point it does not have Vega convexity. This does not mean that its Vega is not \\nsensitive to volatility movements; on the contrary, Vega even changes sign at this point, but \\nATM V olga is zero. Figure 13.2 gives the V olga of a call spread which is essentially what this \\ncliquet is, a sum of forward starting −10%, +10% call spreads. In this case, from a pricing \\nstandpoint, we are left with the primary concern of getting the forward skews correct and are 216 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n0% \\n–1.5 –1 –0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 \\n50% 100% 150% 200% \\nVolga of Call Spread Volga of –10% Strike Call Volga of +10% Strike Call \\nFigure 13.2 Here we see the V olga of a +10% call and that of a −10% strike call (both are positive). \\nThe difference between them is the V olga of the call spread, which at-the-money is zero. This assumes \\nzero rates and divs, and a vol of 25% for both call options. Overall this graph might be more confusing \\nthan useful as V olga changes sign three times, but what is useful is for us to see that, at-the-money, our \\nsymmetric call spread has zero V olga. \\nnot too concerned with the Vega convexity, given it is zero (or very close to it). However, as \\nthe market moves the product will begin to exhibit varying levels of Vega convexity. \\nWhen the local  ﬂoor or the cap are positioned differently, introducing asymmetry, as in the \\ncase of local ﬂoor set to zero and local cap at 5%, we begin to pick up V olga. This happens in \\nmuch the same way that the Vegas of the two call options in a call spread cancel each other less \\nas the caps and ﬂoors become more asymmetric. So, in the case of the 0% locally ﬂoored 5% \\nlocally capped cliquet, as in the above example, the sellers will be mainly exposure to forward \\nskew, with the Vega convexity, which the seller of the option is short, gradually increasing. \\nNaturally, we also have the usual price convexity to take care of: we have our Delta and our \\nGamma. \\nMuch like the  Vega changes sign for a cliquet, so does the Gamma. If there is a time for \\none to look at a higher order it is for an option like this for which the Gamma changes sign. \\nThe third-order effect, the sensitivity of Gamma to a movement in the underlying’s price, is \\nknown as Speed and deﬁned as \\nN /prime(d1) /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg ∂3C =− e−qT d1Speed = √ √ +1 ∂ S3 σ TS2 σ T \\nThe essential  idea  of this graph will be to notice the point at which the Gamma changes sign \\nto see how sensitive it would be to a movement in either direction of the underlying. As we saw \\nbefore with Gamma, one will need to compute the two-sided Gamma, that is, the sensitivity \\nto the underlying’s price going up, and also (but computed separately) the case when its price \\ngoes down. \\nIn conclusion,  generally , given the nature of these proﬁles – especially that the Vega proﬁle \\ncan change – we will have to use a stochastic volatility model for such options. In Appendix \\nA, section A.3, we further explain the need for stochastic volatility models. /summationdisplay \\n/bracketleftBigg /bracketrightBigg /summationdisplay 217 The Cliquet Family \\nA question that arises is: Do we have data regarding forward skew to calibrate to? If one \\nis able to obtain broker quotes for some standardized cliquets, or get information regarding \\nthe market consensus on speciﬁc cliquets, it is possible to conduct a parameterization of the \\nforward skew the same way in which the regular implied volatility skew was parameterized in \\nChapter 4, and these prices matched during calibration as additional calibration instruments. \\nIdeally we would be able to ﬁnd the implied volatilities for all forward starting call options of \\nall tenors and all maturities and all strikes and use these, but there is no liquid market for such \\nthings as yet. If we were able to obtain 90–110% symmetric cliquets in the market with 1-year \\nresets, then this could be used for the parameterization of the year to year forward skew. \\nThis parameterization  can  of course be modiﬁed as described in Chapter 4 to use the \\n95–105% skew if the cliquet with these points as caps and ﬂoors is available instead of the \\n90–110% version. Having quotes for the 100–110% cliquet, we will also have information \\nabout Vega convexity. For a month-to-month cliquet we would have to use a 98–102% cliquet \\nas caps and ﬂoors at 10% apart do not make sense for a monthly cliquet. \\n13.4 REVERSE CLIQUETS  \\nIn this variant on the standard cliquet, the reverse cliquet begins with a headline coupon, and \\ninstead of accumulating positive performances in an underlying asset, negative returns are \\ndeducted from said coupon. At maturity, the holder of the reverse cliquet receives the part of \\nthe coupon that is left after the deduction of the (possibly ﬂoored) negative period to period \\nperformances: \\n/bracketleftBigg /bracketrightBigg n \\nReverse Cliquet payoff = max 0 , MaxCoupon + min[0; Ret ti ] \\ni =1 \\nwhere Ret ti are the usual cliquet style periodic returns, and MaxCoupon is a large above-\\nmarket coupon which the bullish investor hopes to collect in its entirety, should the index have \\na positive performance every month from start to maturity. Here we have set the local cap and \\nthe global ﬂoor to zero. \\nWe should  note  that the global ﬂoor here plays an important role as there is a very large \\npotential downside should there be continuously large down movements in the index. This \\nﬂoor will be absolutely necessary if one is to ﬁt this option into a principal-protected structure. \\nThe upside is that theoretically this option could pay MaxCoupon if there are no negative \\nreturns to eat away at said coupon. With capital guaranteed, this makes for an interesting \\nproduct, and in the structure of section 3.10 the coupon would be adjusted for this option to \\nﬁt into the structure. \\nThis payof f can  be rewritten as \\nn \\nReverse Cliquet payoff = max 0 , MaxCoupon − max[0; −Ret ti ] \\ni =1 \\nwhere it is now clear that we are subtracting from the coupon the set of all ATM puts that end \\nin-the-money. In this payoff we have speciﬁed the global ﬂoor to be zero, and in this case it is \\nclear that the seller of the reverse cliquet is effectively long these puts. Since they are ATM, \\nwe ﬁnd low skew sensitivity, which can potentially increase; however, it is highly convex in \\nVega and we must tread with extreme caution on this risk from the onset. \\nNote the scenarios  of Table 13.4 with the payout of the reverse cliquet in comparison to the \\nlocally ﬂoored/locally capped cliquet. 218 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nTable 13.4 Scenario  observ ations of the index performances on the 3 years. Note that only the \\nnegative returns contribute to the ﬁnal payoff of the reverse cliquet with headline coupon of 15%. The \\nLFLC cliquet is there for comparison with LC = 10% and LF = 0%. \\nYear 1 Y ear 2 Y ear 3 LFLC  cliquet  Re verse cliquet \\nScenario 1 0%  0% 5% 5% 15% \\nScenario 2 0%  −2% 5% 5% 13% \\nScenario 3 − 6% −5% 10% 10% 4% \\nScenario 4 − 2% 5% 13% 15% 13% \\nScenario 5 5%  11% 16% 25% 15% \\nReverse Cliquet Risks \\nThe reason  the  structure appeals to investors in an environment of high volatility is that the \\nseller of the reverse cliquet will be buying volatility at this high level, and is thus able to offer \\na higher headline coupon to the investor. As volatility goes down, the price goes up, meaning \\nthat this would be perfect for an investor wanting to buy an option during a bear market (high \\nvolatility) with the view that it is almost over. \\nWith respect  to  forward skews we can think of this structure as follows. The investor is short \\nATM puts, but he is also long the global ﬂoor that acts like a strip of OTM puts. Thinking \\nabout this as a put spread, the seller of the reverse cliquet, who is long the put spreads, is short \\nskew, and forward skew in this case owing to the reset feature. Since this option is highly \\nconvex in Vega (and the seller is short Vega convexity) we expect the reverse cliquet to be \\nworth much more under stochastic volatility than local volatility, reﬂecting not only the ﬂatter \\nskew the local vol generates but, more importantly, the fact that local volatility does not know \\nabout Vega convexity. Increasing the global ﬂoor up from zero can only increase this Vega \\nconvexity further. \\nRegarding rev erse cliquet Vega convexity, the seller of the reverse cliquet will need to buy \\nvolatility when volatility increases, and sell volatility when volatility decreases. Assuming \\nthat we are in a high-volatility period, we expect to have large negative returns (the puts) \\nthat will eat away the headline coupon, thus the seller has a low volatility sensitivity in this \\nenvironment. The opposite is true in the case of low volatility when the option’s Vega is \\nrelatively high. This is saying that the Vega of the reverse cliquet is a non-constant function of \\nvolatility itself, thus Vega convexity, and there is need for a stochastic volatility model. This \\nis also equivalent to saying that there is a large vol-of-vol effect, and this must be priced to \\nreﬂect the cost of dynamically hedging this convexity; Vega hedges will need to be adjusted \\nas volatility changes. \\nWe have to  deal with forward skew, and in the case of reverse cliquets and in all the cliquet \\nstructures to come, it makes sense to additionally calibrate to the cliquets quotes from a broker \\nor data from a consensus of market makers’ mid-market prices, if possible. To assume that any \\nmodel is pricing reverse cliquets correctly, a ﬁrst step is to see that it is pricing known cliquets \\ncorrectly to make sure that we are headed in the right direction. This will mean that we have \\ncaptured the levels at which the market is pricing forward skews (and some convexities) much \\nlike those we previously calibrated to the vanilla options market. /summationdisplay \\n/braceleftbigg \\n/bracketleftBigg /parenleftBigg /parenrightBigg/bracketrightBigg /summationdisplay 14 \\nMore Cliquets and Related Structures  \\nIf stock markets were like computers, then cliquets would deﬁnitely be the best ﬁnancial products. \\nWhen the system crashes, you just need to restart to boost the performance. \\nIn this chapter we continue our discussion of cliquets, introduce other cliquet variations \\nand also structures that share similar risks. These include digital cliquets, bearish cliquets, \\naccumulators (cliquets with lock-in features where the option holder locks in returns) and \\nreplacement cliquets. We also look into multi-asset cliquets including basket cliquets, best-of \\ncliquets, ICBC cliquets and rainbow cliquets. These bring up the concepts of correlation and \\ndispersion that we have seen in Chapters 7, 8 and 9, in addition to the new risks involved in \\ncliquets. The discussion of Napoleons and lookbacks respectively form the last two sections \\nof this chapter. These will each have various sensitivities, including possibly Vega convexity \\nor forward skew, which must again be made transparent and, in turn, correctly priced. They \\nalso present interesting examples for the ongoing discussion of the smile dynamics of pricing \\nmodels. \\n14.1 OTHER CLIQUETS  \\n14.1.1 Digital Cliquets \\nThe digital  cliquet  is an extension of the regular cliquet and the digital options we saw in \\nChapter 11. Let’s start with a simple payoff: \\nn \\nDigital Cliquet payoff = C(i )1{Ret ti ≥K }\\ni =1 \\nwhere C(i ) is the agreed coupon for year i , and Ret ti is the cliquet style return for the i th \\nperiod, Ret ti = (Sti /Sti −1) − 1. As usual, 1 is the indicator function \\n1i f R e t ti ≥ K1{Ret ti ≥K }= 0i f Re tti < K \\nThis is just  the sum of forward starting digitals. Using these it is easy to describe a retail \\nproduct: let K = 0, then for each year in which the index has gone up on its value at the start \\nof that year, you receive a ﬁxed coupon C. The coupons do not necessarily have to be equal, \\nbut they must be speciﬁed in advance. One can add global caps and ﬂoors to make it look like \\nn \\nDigital Cliquet payoff = max GF, min GC, C(i )1{Ret ti >K}\\ni =1 \\nSince all the digital returns are positive, the global ﬂoor will act as a minimum guarantee and \\nthe global cap will help to reduce the price. \\nConsidering the risks:  if we recall Chapter 11 on digitals, we must be especially cautious \\nabout the digital’s skew exposure – here, the forward skew. If we were to not account for this /bracketleftBigg /bracketrightBigg /summationdisplay \\n/bracketleftBigg /bracketrightBigg /summationdisplay 220 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nTable 14.1 Digital  cliquet  scenario observations of the index \\nperformances on the 3 years. The digital coupon is set at 6%, and trigger is \\nset to 0%. The LFLC cliquet is there for comparison with LC = 10% and \\nLF = 0%. \\nYear 1 Y ear 2 Y ear 3 LFLC  cliquet  Digital  cliquet \\nScenario 1 0%  0% 5% 5% 18% \\nScenario 2 0%  −2% 5% 5% 12% \\nScenario 3 − 6% −5% 10% 10% 6% \\nScenario 4 − 2% 5% 13% 15% 12% \\nScenario 5 5%  11% 16% 25% 18% \\nskew, then we would have a problem as we would be certain to underprice the option. Our \\nhedge in general would be similar to that of the regular digital, only here instead of using a \\ncall spread we will use a series of forward starting call spreads, or, even better, use a regular \\ncliquet (with the correct caps and ﬂoors). As with any digital we must consider the size of the \\ndigital and make sure we can trade the underlying through the strike, i.e. check the liquidity of \\nthe underlying and take whatever shifts are necessary to smoothen the Greeks near the digital \\nstrike. \\nIn the case  of the digital cliquet, the seller of the option is short forward skew, but what \\nabout volatility? If we regard the digital as a call spread (which will be necessary for purposes \\nof smoothing the hedge ratios) then whether the seller of the option is long or short volatility \\nwill depend on where this digital is struck and the width of the call spreads. (See section 11.1.3 \\non hedging digital options for more details.) \\nOne thing  to  note regarding the width of the call spreads necessary is that most cliquets are \\nwritten on indices, so we are faced with less problems of liquidity as we will always ﬁnd that \\ntrading index futures is more liquid than the underlying stocks. \\n14.1.2 Bearish Cliquets  \\nConsider\\n the case  of an investor who is quite bearish in the short/medium term on global equity \\nindices. An interesting product would be a bearish cliquet, also known as a bearish reverse \\ncliquet because of its payoff, although one should not confuse this with the real reverse cliquet \\ndescribed in section 13.4. Let’s start with the payoff: \\nn \\nBearish Cliquet payoff = max 0, Coupon − max(0; Ret i ) \\ni =1 \\nwhere again Ret i are the periodic cliquet style returns. This can equivalently be written as \\nn \\nBearish Cliquet payoff = max 0, Coupon − ATM Monthly Calls \\ni=1 \\nThis is obviously the case of a cliquet resetting on a monthly basis. The view here is bearish, \\nthat is, if the index goes down several months in succession, the investor receives the (full) \\ncoupon – as deﬁned, the maximum possible payout is the coupon itself. These would be \\nattractive to investors with a bearish view, and would generally be of short maturity (6 months \\nfor example) and serve as a protection product. /bracketleftBigg /bracketrightBigg /summationdisplay 221 More Cliquets and Related  Structures \\nTable 14.2 Scenario  observ ations of the monthly index performances over 6 \\nmonths. Note that only positive returns eat away at the coupon – this is after all a \\nbearish product. In this example we assume a headline coupon of 10%. \\nM1 M2 M3 M4 M5 M6 Bearish cliquet  \\nScenario\\n 1 1%  −1% 2% 0% 1% 1.5% 4.5% \\nScenario 2 − 1% −2% 1% −1% −3% 1% 8% \\nScenario 3 1%  2% 2% 3% −1% 2% 0% \\nWhat is interesting about this structure from the sell side is that the seller of this option \\nis long both forward skew and Vega convexity. To elaborate, the seller of the option is in \\nthis case buying forward skew, but the skew sensitivity is not very high; we expect this as \\nthe calls appearing in the formula are in fact ATM. We can replace these by OTM or ITM \\ncalls depending on the requirements, and this would increase the level of the forward skew \\nsensitivity. \\nAs for the  Vega convexity, the fact that such sensitivity is negative (to the seller) means \\nthat as volatility goes up the Vega of the option goes down. Intuitively this makes sense as an \\nincrease in volatility would raise the calls appearing in the sum, thus reducing the coupon the \\nseller will have to pay at maturity. As a month goes by with the coupon further eaten away \\n(see Table 14.2), there is less and less uncertainty as to how much will have to be paid out at \\nmaturity. 14.1.3 Variable Cap Cliquets\\n  \\nWe can structure  a cliquet so that it has local caps, but at the same time offers the investor \\nsomething more appealing than a ﬁxed cap. For example, let’s assume that the investor wants a \\n−5%, +5% 2-year cliquet with quarterly resets, but is concerned there may be higher returns \\nthat she does not want to miss. We can introduce variable caps so that if a return supersedes \\nthe cap we take that return as the next quarter’s new cap. Any period return to go above the \\ncap (of that period) is capped at the current level of the cap but is then set as the new cap: \\nn \\nVariable Cap Cliquet payoff = max 0, min(LC( i ), max (LF, Ret( i ))) \\ni=1 \\nwhere the local cap LC( i ) can vary at each period depending on the returns in the following \\nmanner. The ﬁrst cap LC(1) is ﬁxed at 5%, for example. The local caps for the subsequent \\nperiods are given by \\nLC( i )  = max (LC( i − 1), Ret( i − 1)) \\nthat is, the  cap for any period is the maximum between the last period’s cap and the last \\nperiod’s return. We should note that the local cap will always be at least equal to the starting \\ncap LC(1) so this cliquet will cost more than the same cliquet with the same cap, but is a \\ncheaper alternative than raising the cap and constitutes a great product if one expects several \\nlarge positive returns. \\nNaturally with the  local caps and ﬂoors we have a large forward skew sensitivity, much like \\nthe case of the constant cap cliquet in terms of direction, only greater in value. With these and /summationdisplay \\n/summationdisplay 222 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nthe global ﬂoors the seller of the option is again selling Vega convexity and must account for \\nthis in the pricing, although again the effect of forward skew is greater than the Vega convexity. \\n14.1.4 Accumulators/Lock-in Cliquets  \\nThis\\n is a  cliquet structure in which returns can be locked in as the minimum payout of the \\noption. The payout  is as follows: \\n/bracketleftBigg /bracketrightBigg n \\nLock-in Cliquetpayoff =max 0%, min(LC, max (LF, Ret( i ))) , Lock \\ni =1 \\nSo this is just a regular globally ﬂoored, locally ﬂoored, locally capped cliquet, but with an \\nadditional embedded lock-in feature. The lock is determined on the basis of accumulated \\nreturns, computed as follows: \\nj\\nAcc Ret( j ) = min (LC, max (LF, Ret( i ))) \\ni=1 \\nthat is, Acc Ret at time j is the sum of the locally ﬂoored, locally capped cliquet style returns \\nfrom the start and up to time j . Obviously, the sum of all of them, Acc Ret(n ), is what appears \\nin the above payout, which we can write as \\nLock-in Cliquetpayoff =max [0%, Acc Ret( n), Lock ] \\nOne must  specify  the levels of the lock-in, here for example we set the levels at 10%, 20% and \\n30%, and deﬁne the lock as follows: \\n(a) If Acc Ret(  j ) was ever above 30% then the lock is set to 30%. \\n(b) If Acc Ret(  j ) was ever above 20% then the lock is set to 20%. \\n(c) If Acc Ret(  j ) was ever above 10% then the lock is set to 10%. \\n(d) Otherwise the lock =0.  \\nThat is, if  at any point j the returns so far add up to the one above any of these levels, then that \\nlevel is locked in and the payoff will be at least that much. Since the local ﬂoor will be set to a \\nvalue below zero (for example LF =−2%, LC =2% for monthly returns on a 3-year lock-in \\ncliquet), the accumulated returns can exceed 10%, but some negative returns can eat away \\nthis return. In the case of the lock-in, if accumulated returns ever reach 10% (or 20% or 30%) \\nthen the investor is guaranteed at least that percentage. See Table 14.3 for some scenarios to \\nillustrate the payoff of accumulators. \\nThis structure  has  a higher potential return than the same cliquet without the lock-in as it \\nallows the investor to capture a good run of returns and not have to worry that they may be \\nlost. Obviously this would cost a bit more than the same cliquet without the lock-in, and it too \\ncan potentially have zero payoff if all the returns are negative. \\n14.1.5 Replacement Cliquets  \\nReplacement\\n cliquets,  also  known as take-N cliquets , pay out the sum of all periodic returns \\nwhere the best, predetermined number, of returns are replaced with a predeﬁned ﬁxed coupon. /bracketleftBigg /bracketrightBigg /summationdisplay 223 More Cliquets and Related  Structures \\nTable 14.3 Lock-in  cliquet scenarios.

The ﬁrst bold row represents the \\npayoff of the LFLC cliquet without lock-in, the second is the lock achieved, and the third \\nis the payoff of the lock-in cliquet. \\nScenario 1 2  3 \\nMonth j Ret(  j )  Accum( j )  R e t ( j )  Accum( j )  R e t ( j )  Accum( j )  \\nMonth 1 1% 1% 1% 1% 2% 2% \\nMonth 2 2% 3% 3% 4% 1.5% 3.5% \\nMonth 3 1% 4% 2% 6% 1% 4.5% \\nMonth 4 0% 4% 2.5% 8.5% 2% 6.5% \\nMonth 5 3.5% 7% 1% 9.5% 2% 8.5% \\nMonth 6 1% 8% 1.5% 11% 4% 11.5% \\nMonth 7 −1% 7% 2% 13% 2% 13.5% \\nMonth 8 0.5% 7.5% 2% 15% −1.5% 12% \\nMonth 9 0.5% 8% 2.5% 17.5% −1% 11% \\nMonth 10 −1% 7% 1.5% 19% −2% 9% \\nMonth 11 0% 7% 2% 21% −4% 6% \\nMonth 12 −2% 5% −2% 19% −2% 4% \\nLFLC Cliq.  5%  19% 4% \\nLock-in Cliq.  0%  20% 10% \\nAccumulator 5% 20% 10% \\nOne can set the returns to be based on the periodic ATM performances of the underlying, and \\nassume that the structure accumulates these returns and pays only at maturity. \\nThis option  w ould be good for someone with a softly bullish view. To understand why, and \\nalso be clear on the payoff mechanism, let’s write the payoff then look at some scenarios. The \\npayoff itself seems more complicated than it is and can be made clear with the scenarios. Let’s \\nassume this to be a 1-year trade with monthly resets and a global ﬂoor of 1%. The payoff (with \\nthe best ﬁve monthly returns replaced by 3%) is: \\n12 \\nReplacement Cliquet payoff = max 1%, Rett∗ i \\ni=1 \\nwhere the set of returns Ret∗ t\\ni is the same as the usual Ret ti = (Sti /Sti −1) − 1. \\nIn Table 14.4  we show some scenarios for a 6-month option, as this is just to illustrate the \\npoint. In the ﬁrst scenario, the investor has forgone the relatively large positive returns as they \\nhave been replaced by 2%. In the second scenario, the replacement mechanism has raised the \\npayout, as two of the three best returns are below 2%. In the last scenario, the replacement did \\nenhance the top three returns, but the large negative returns were the governing factor and the \\nglobal ﬂoor of 1% kicked in to give the return at maturity. \\nA moderately  b ullish view is represented here because if we were extremely bullish we \\nwould not want the best returns to be replaced by 2% as they may be higher and contribute \\ntowards a higher overall payoff. On the other hand, even if none of the returns reach 2% we \\nstill replace the best three returns, which can potentially be less than 2%, with 2%. Put, with /summationdisplay 224 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nTable 14.4 Scenario  observ ations of the monthly index performances over 6 \\nmonths. Note that the best three returns are replaced by 2%. The bold returns are the \\nthree that are replaced.

Here \\nwe mention a few interesting combinations and then discuss the risks involved in moving to \\nmulti-asset cliquet structures. \\nBasket Cliquets  \\nStarting\\n with a  basket of N assets, we can structure a cliquet on the basket, meaning that \\neach period’s return is computed on the basis of the returns of the basket. We can replace \\nthe single asset returns with the basket returns in the cliquets above. One can, for example, \\nstructure a GFLC cliquet that pays on the world basket of EuroStoxx, Nikkei and S&P 500 as \\na retail product that now provides the same beneﬁts as the GFLC cliquet structure in addition \\nto providing exposure to a set of global indices instead of just one index or stock. \\nBest-of Cliquets Let’s start with\\n  a basket of N stocks, then each cliquet is just the return of the best performing \\nasset in that period. At the end of each period i , we observe the individual returns Ret( i, j )o f \\nthe shares j composing the underlying basket. Let the maturity be 3 years and the observations \\nmade on an annual basis. \\nS(i, j  )Ret( i, j  ) = − 1, i = 1, 2, 3 and j = 1 ... N S(i −  1, j ) \\nthen the payoff of a locally ﬂoored locally capped best-of cliquet is as follows: \\n3 /bracketleftbigg /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg \\nLFLC BO Cliquet payoff = max F, min max Ret( i, j ), C \\nj =1,..., N i =1 \\nAs before, the seller of the option will be short dispersion (see the section on best-of options \\nin Chapter 8 for details). In addition to the analysis there, the seller is, as expected, exposed to \\nforward skew due to the resetting. /bracketleftbig /bracketrightbig \\n/summationdisplay 225 More Cliquets and Related  Structures \\nRainbow Cliquets \\nWe can structure  a rainbow cliquet the same way we do a best-of cliquet, only that each \\nperiod’s return is a weighted sum of the best j returns among the N assets. Specifying weights \\nsuch as 50% on the best, 30% on the second best and 20% on the third best, this cliquet would \\nprice, all else being equal, at less than the best-of option and higher than the basket option. \\nICBC Cliquets Put simply , this\\n  is an ICBC that resets. The individually capped basket call (ICBC) cliquet is \\nbased on a basket of N stocks. Assume that we are interested in a 3-year product with annual \\nresets. At the end of each year i , we observe the individual returns Ret j (i ) of the shares j \\ncomposing the underlying basket: \\nSj (i )Ret j (i ) = − 1, i = 1,2,3 and j = 1 ...N Sj (i − 1) \\nThen we cap  each stock performance at Cap% (say 20%). The individual capped returns \\nCapped Ret j (i ) are computed as follows: \\nCapped Ret j (i ) = min Ret j (i ),Cap% \\nThe holder  of  the option receives an annual coupon, Coupon (i ) (ﬂoored at 0%) of value of \\nthe arithmetic average of the capped returns. \\n⎡ ⎤ \\n1\\n N \\n⎦ Coupon( i )  = max ⎣0, × Capped Ret j (i )N j=1 \\nOf course, the coupon can be paid periodically (monthly, quarterly, annually) or at maturity \\nof the option, depending on the terms agreed by the contract. \\n14.2.2 Multi-asset Cliquet Risks  \\nWhen\\n discussing  the  basket, ICBC, best-of and rainbow cliquets, some of the risks are similar \\nto those of the regular versions (non-cliquet style returns). Obviously here, with the new risks \\nof Vega convexity and forward skew, we will need to go into details, but the common risks \\nwill be similar. \\nIn the best-of  version the seller is short dispersion. The effect of correlation on the rainbow, \\nas before, lies somewhere between the best-of cliquet (high correlation sensitivity) and the \\nbasket cliquet (lower correlation sensitivity). This means that the seller of the rainbow could \\nbe long or short correlation, whereas the seller of the best-of is long correlation and short \\nvolatility. In the ICBC the seller is short the correlations between the assets and long their \\nvolatilities. For the basket cliquet the seller is short both correlation and volatility. \\nIn the cliquet  case there is forward skew exposure, but the forward skew positions are the \\nsame as the cases of the regular skew exposure in the regular case. The seller of an ICBC \\ncliquet, for example, is short forward skew. There is Vega convexity in each of these products, \\nmuch like the single asset cliquet versions, only here we will also see cross Vega terms, that \\nis, the effect a move of one volatility has on the Vega of the others. This is picked up with \\nthe use of a multi-asset stochastic volatility model. With this, one would have to calibrate /bracketleftbig /parenleftbig /parenrightbig/bracketrightbig 226 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nthe parameters of the correlation between the different volatilities, and this cannot really be \\nimplied from the market; so one would simply see what the effect is on the speciﬁc option \\nand then take a conservative spread on these values. Correlation between the underlyings \\nthemselves is handled as normal. \\n14.3 NAPOLEONS \\n14.3.1 The Napoleon  Structur e \\nThe Napoleon  is  a structure that pays a coupon at maturity, which is a pre-agreed headline \\ncoupon plus the worst period return. It is more probable than not that this worst return will \\nbe negative and thus the coupon at maturity is expected to be less than the headline coupon. \\nHowever, to the bullish investor this can be appealing as the headline coupons are generally \\nlarge and deﬁnitely above the market rates. Writing a payoff we have \\nNapoleon payoff = max 0, MaxCoupon + min Ret tii=1,..., n \\nwhere Ret ti is the usual cliquet style period return, and in this case it does not necessarily have \\nto be those of one asset. \\nIn the e xample scenarios of Table 14.5, notice that in scenario 1, even though the Napoleon \\nhas paid a substantial coupon for the 5-year trade, given the index’s performance in the ﬁrst \\nfew years, it seems that there may have been better products to buy, for example one of the \\nabove cliquets. In scenario 2 the extremely bad return in year 4, which corresponds to some \\nsort of market crash, has eaten away a large chunk of the coupon. In scenario 3, all the annual \\nreturns are positive, albeit small, and the Napoleon’s payoff in fact exceeds the 50% coupon. In \\nthe ﬁnal scenario we see that although the index’s performance is relatively poor throughout, \\nthere was no large negative annual return and the Napoleon has a nice payout. This should \\nemphasize the nature of the Napoleon in terms of which views it expresses. \\nAs in the  case of the reverse cliquet above, the seller of a Napoleon will need to buy volatility \\nwhen volatility increases, and sell volatility when volatility decreases. If we assume that we \\nare in a high volatility period, we expect that a large negative return will eat away the headline \\ncoupon, thus giving a lower volatility sensitivity in this environment. The opposite is true \\nin the case of low volatility when the option’s Vega becomes quite high. This is saying that \\nthe Vega of the Napoleon is a function of volatility itself, thus we have Vega convexity and \\nthe need to use a stochastic volatility model. This is also equivalent to saying that there is a \\nlarge vol-of-vol effect, and this must be priced to reﬂect the cost of hedging this convexity: \\nTable 14.5 Scenario observations of the annual index returns over 5 \\nyears. See the worst returns in bold. We assume a headline coupon of \\n50% for the Napoleon \\nYear 1 Y ear 2 Y ear 3 Y ear 4 Y ear 5 Napoleon  \\nScenario 1 15%  13% 19% 7% –11% 39% \\nScenario 2 15%  8% 6% –34% 5% 16% \\nScenario 3 2%  4% 9% 1% 4% 51% \\nScenario 4 13%  −9% –10% −5% −9% 40% /bracketleftbig /parenleftbig /parenrightbig/bracketrightbig 227 More Cliquets and Related  Structures \\nVega hedges will need to be adjusted as volatility changes, especially so when volatility rises \\nsigniﬁcantly during a market decline. \\nThe volatility hedging  instruments are European options of different maturities, ideally going \\nout to the maturity of the Napoleon, and the stochastic volatility model must be calibrated \\nto these correctly to show the risk against them. The Napoleon has Vega distributed along \\nthe time-buckets, and depending on how the term structure of volatilities changes, the Vega \\nsensitivity in the different Vega buckets will change. The effect of skew for a Napoleon depends \\non the size of the coupon, and the seller of the Napoleon is generally long skew. So, in addition \\nto the term structure, one must calibrate to the OTM European options that can also serve \\nas hedging instruments. We refer to Chapter 4 for discussions of trading the skew and its \\nconvexity with combinations of European options. \\n14.3.2 The Bearish  Napoleon  \\nOne can modify  the payoff of the Napoleon to make it into a bearish structure. By taking the \\nbest period return and subtracting it, this now suits someone with a bearish view \\nBearish Napoleon payoff = max 0, MaxCoupon − max Ret tii =1,...,n \\nin that only positive returns can now eat away at the headline coupon. What is interesting in \\nthis product from the pricing perspective is that the large Vega convexity cost the seller must \\ncharge for the regular Napoleon is now reversed and, in fact, is a Vega convexity beneﬁt for the \\nbuyer. How much of this beneﬁt the seller chooses to offer is a function of his aggressiveness \\nand the state of competition. Similar to most bearish structures, these will generally only be \\nbought on much shorter maturities than the regular Napoleons. \\n14.4 LOOKBACK OPTIONS \\n14.4.1 The Various Lookback  Payoffs \\nThere are se veral different types of lookback options, and the ﬁrst question one must ask \\nwhen encountering the term lookback options is “which lookback is this referring to?”. As \\nthe name suggests, a lookback option’s payoff at maturity depends on some value reached by \\nthe underlying asset’s price during the life of the option and at maturity: looking back at this \\nvalue, in hindsight, the payoff is computed. An example of this is the lookback call where the \\npayoff depends on the maximum level reached by the underlying, so the payoff is given by \\n(S˜− K )+, where S˜is the maximum  stock price over the life of the option, with K as the ﬁxed \\nstrike price. This lookback we shall refer to as the “Max spot lookback”. Lookback structures \\nhave been placed in this chapter because they can carry some forward skew risk and have \\nsensitivity to smile dynamics. \\nOther lookbacks  include  the put version of the above option that now involves the minimum \\nover the life of the option. It is also possible to have a ﬂoating strike lookback option. The \\nﬂoating strike lookback call option in this case pays the difference between the asset price at \\nmaturity and the ﬂoating strike that is the minimum value reached by the underlying during \\nthe life of the option. The idea is that the investor is buying the underlying at maturity at the \\nlowest value it attained throughout the life of the option, compared to the standard call option \\nwhere the investor is buying the underlying at a ﬁxed strike price. A similar argument holds 228 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nTable 14.6 Lookback  scenarios.  \\nMinimum Maximum  Final  \\nSeries 1 99.19%  110.40%  105.46% \\nSeries 2 98.83% 116.28% 116.28% \\nSeries 3 94.12% 104.81% 99.12% \\nfor the lookback put in comparison to the European put option, only the investor here is selling \\nthe underlying at a more favourable price than the standard put. \\nThese possible  features  imply that the lookback is a path-dependent option in the sense that \\nthe payoff of the derivative is dependent on the path followed by the underlying asset and \\nnot just its ﬁnal value. If we assume that the lookback option is monitored continuously, then \\nthere exist closed formulas for the lookback option (see Garman, 1989 and Goldman et al., \\n1979). The price of the lookback is obviously sensitive to the frequency at which the maximum \\n(or minimum) is observed (continuously, daily closes, weekly, monthly,...) and a formula by \\nBroadie, et al. (1998), analogous to that discussed in the chapter on barrier options, serves as \\na correction to move from continuous monitoring to discrete monitoring. \\nThe minimum,  maximum  and ﬁnal value of each of the series in Figure 14.1 are given \\nin Table 14.6; and the prices of the maximum spot lookback call (with strike at 100%), the \\nﬂoating strike lookback call, and the European ATM call are given in Table 14.7. \\n14.4.2 Hedging Lookbacks  \\nT\\no understand  the  lookback structure’s risks, let’s ﬁrst consider a hedging argument. A standard \\nhedging argument for the max spot lookback is that the seller of the option buys two call options \\nwith the same strike as the lookback. In the literature, hedging arguments of this nature for the \\nlookback were ﬁrst proposed by Goldman et al. (1979) and appear in texts such as Gatheral \\n(2006). Considering various scenarios we ﬁrst note that if the underlying never goes above the \\nstrike then both the lookback and the call options expire worthless. If and when the underlying \\nreaches the strike, then the call options are ATM. If the underlying then goes above the strike, \\n115% 110% 105% 100% \\n95% \\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 \\nSeries 1 Series 2 Series 3 \\nFigure 14.1 Path scenarios for three underlying assets over a 3-year period.

Since the two call options were ATM, using what we \\nlearned about the Delta of call options in Chapter 5 we know that Delta of an ATM call is close \\nto 0.5, which means that as the spot increases by an amount, say /Delta1K , we expect the value of \\nthe call to increase by 0.5 × /Delta1K . This means that if we hold two call options then, combined, \\nthey will increase by an amount 2 × 0.5 × /Delta1K = /Delta1K , the same amount as the increase in the \\nlookback. At this point we immediately sell the two calls, locking in this value, and then buy \\nanother two calls struck ATM which is now S = K + /Delta1K . The argument continues as such \\nin that the same thing holds: if the spot goes up further, we lock in the value by selling the two \\ncalls and buying two new ATM calls. In reality, Delta is not 0.5 and this is a slightly simplistic \\nargument. The real amount of call options needed to be held is slightly below 2, however this \\ndoes allow us to look further at the structure to think about the other risks. To see the skew \\nposition we must discuss the concepts of sticky strike and sticky Delta. \\n14.4.3 Sticky Strik e  and Sticky Delta \\nThe sticky strik e and sticky Delta models were introduced by Derman (1999). In the sticky \\nDelta model, we assume that the implied volatility skew is related to speciﬁc strikes in that \\nthe shape of the skew will not change as the underlying moves. In the sticky Delta model the \\nwhole implied volatility skew moves with the underlying. For example: if a 100 strike call has \\na Delta of 0.56 and the ATM implied volatility is 20%, and if the underlying moves downwards \\nand the 95 strike option now has a Delta of 0.56, then we expect the skew to move in line \\nwith this and see the implied volatility of the 95 strike option at 20%. These two models serve \\nmainly as toys in the sense that neither is a real reﬂection of what one observes in the market. \\nIn fact what one observes is somewhere between these two. \\n14.4.4 Skew Risk  in Lookbacks \\nApplying these  tw o models to the lookback, and following the hedging argument using the \\ntwo call options, we can see that if we assume any one of the sticky strike or sticky Delta \\nmodels, we see a skew beneﬁt for the investor (seller of the option is long skew). In the sticky \\nstrike case, as the spot increases to K + /Delta1K and we sell the two call options and buy two new \\nones ATM, we see that in the presence of skew, the two new call options we buy are priced \\nwith a lower implied volatility (the skew has not moved). Lower implied vol in the presence \\nof skew means a lower cost to buy the two new call options and thus the skew beneﬁt. In the \\ncase of sticky Delta, the two new options we buy are also ATM, meaning that we expect them \\nto have the same Delta as the previous calls we bought, the same implied volatility (sticky 230 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nDelta), and in this case we see little skew effect. If we assume the reality to be a blend between \\nthese two possible models, then the skew beneﬁt becomes apparent. \\nThe lookback  can  carry forward skew risk. Consider the case of the ﬂoating strike lookback. \\nHere the strike is not determined at the onset and the payoff at maturity is computed on the basis \\nof observations of the underlying (discrete or continuous) and thus carries some forward skew \\nrisk. It is not an explicit forward skew risk as in the case of cliquets: the lookback is sensitive \\nto how the implied volatility skew evolves, i.e. smile dynamics. If we were to compare the \\nprice of a lookback option under local volatility with its price under stochastic volatility, we \\nwould see that the lookback is cheaper under the latter. This is because a stochastic volatility \\nmodel propagates some forward skew in its dynamics, whereas local volatility’s forward skew \\nfades, as discussed previously. Less skew generated by the model means less skew beneﬁt to \\nthe option buyer, which means a higher price. \\nHow much  forw ard skew and how serious the difference in price is between the stochastic \\nand local volatility models is a function of the fraction of the maturity of the option over which \\nwe observe and compute the ﬂoating strike. Take, as an example, a 3-year lookback where the \\nﬂoating strike is computed as the minimum value of the spot reached during the ﬁrst month. \\nThe effect will be much less, due to less sensitivity to the assumed smile dynamics, than if \\nthe lookback strike were taken to be the minimum level reached throughout the life of the \\noption. It would be prudent to price such an option with both models to gauge this effect before \\nmaking a price. The analysis presented here extends to options that contain lookback features \\nas just part of the payoff. \\nProduct Example:  Lookbac k Strike Shark \\nAs a product  example consider a lookback strike shark (knock-out call with rebate as in section \\n10.4.1 of Chapter  10).  This would serve as a product for the investor who is bearish in the \\nshort/medium term and bullish in the long term. As an example, one can consider a 3-year \\nproduct where the lookback strike is speciﬁed as the lowest monthly close during the ﬁrst year. \\nAdding the lookback feature allows one to tailor additional views into many of the products \\nwe have seen. /braceleftBigg /parenleftBig /parenrightBig 15 \\nMountain Range Options \\nThe man who moved the mountain began by carrying away small stones. \\nOriginally marketed by Soci´et´eG´en´erale in the late 1990s, the mountain range is a series of \\npath-dependent options linked to a basket of underlying assets. In this chapter, we present \\nsome of these options, discussing their payoffs as well as the risks associated with these \\nmountain range options. This chapter provides us with not only the chance to present some \\ninteresting examples of quite popular products, but to also bring together many of the concepts \\nwe have covered so far. The examples shown in this chapter include some of the most popular \\nmountain range options in the market for equity derivatives. In the literature, these are discussed \\nby Quessette (2002), and speciﬁc products by Overhaus (2002) and Overhaus et al. (2007). \\n15.1 ALTIPLANO \\nThe Altiplano option is a multi-asset derivative with a payoff based on the returns of n assets \\nS1,S2,..., Sn composing the underlying basket. It entitles the holder to receive a large ﬁxed \\ncoupon C at maturity T , provided that none of the assets in the basket have fallen below \\na predetermined barrier denoted L, during a given time period. This observation period is \\nusually started at the inception date and ends at the maturity date; but can also be a speciﬁc \\ntime sub-period [t1,t2] of the option’s lifetime. If, however, one of the components in the set \\nof chosen underlyings crossed the downside barrier, then the payoff is computed differently, \\nusually by a participation in a call-type payout. Here, we consider the most common case \\nwhere the Altiplano holder receives the payoff of an Asian call option even though the call \\ncan be European style. The Altiplano option payoff is given as: \\nAltiplano payoff = φ × Participation × max [0,Asian Perf − K ] + (1 − φ)C \\nwhere K is  the strike price associated with the call option and φ is a binary variable equal to \\nthe condition set for the index value given as: \\n1 if m i n 1≤ j ≤n, t1 ≤t≤t2 Sj (t ) ≤ L φ = Sj (0) \\n0 otherwise \\nand \\n1 n N /summationdisplay/summationdisplay Sj (i )Asian Perf =  n × Nj =1 i=1 Sj (0) \\nwhere Sj (i ) is the closing price of stock j observed at time i . \\nIn the case  described above, the coupon is paid if the worst performing stock has always \\nbeen higher than the lower trigger during the barrier observation period. Note that more \\ncomplicated variants pay the option holder a coupon if a speciﬁed number of underlying assets \\ndid fall below the barrier level. Also, the participation in the call payout can vary depending 232 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nUnderlying basket 5 European Blue Chip Stocks \\nTenor 5 years \\nCurrency EUR \\nNotional 10 Million EUR \\nBarrier (daily observations) 80% \\nCoupon 150% \\nCall type Asian \\nAveraging Semi-annual \\nStrike 100% \\nParticipation 115% \\nNote 99% \\nCapital protected Ye s \\nFigure 15.1 The terms of an Altiplano structure. \\non the number of assets that break the trigger. The 5-year Altiplano note shown in Figure 15.1 \\noffers the investor an attractive payoff at maturity. Indeed, this structure based on the worst \\nperforming stock on a basket of ﬁve underlying European “Blue Chips” pays the holder the \\nfollowing payout. If all the stocks in the basket have always been above 80% of their initial \\nlevel, the note holder receives 250% of his initial investment at maturity, which represents \\na 20.11% annualized rate of return. Otherwise, 115% participation in the basket-averaged \\npositive performance is paid instead. Figure 15.2 shows two different stocks’ return scenarios; \\nthe dashed lines indicate the basket performance whereas the solid lines constitute the worst \\nstock performance registered over time. On the left, we have a scenario where the lower barrier \\nof 80% has never been crossed during the life of the note. Here, the note holder receives a \\nunique payment at the end of the ﬁfth year equal to 25,000,000 euros (150% in addition to the \\n100% redeemed capital). \\nIn the second  scenario, at least one of the stocks composing the basket has been below \\n80% of its initial level. In this case, the Altiplano note pays the holder 115% participation \\nin an Asian call payoff based on the basket performance. At the end of each semester, the \\nperformance of the basket is observed and computed by taking the arithmetic average of the \\nstocks’ performances with respect to initial date. At maturity, the Asian return is calculated as \\nthe average of the eight observed basket performances. Here, this return is equal to 111.22% \\n80% 90% 100% 120% \\n60% 80% 100% 120% Scenario 1 Scenario 2 \\nBasket Performance Basket Performance 110% \\nWorst Performance Worst Performance \\nFigure 15.2 Two scenarios showing the basket performance as well as the worst performance observed \\nduring the life of the note. /bracketleftbigg /bracketrightbigg 233 Mountain Range Options \\nof the basket initial level. Therefore, the buyer of the Altiplano note receives a coupon of \\n12.90% (= 115% × 11.22%) plus 100% capital protected. \\nAltiplanos are sometimes  considered to be Parisian basket options due to their barrier and \\nAsian characteristics. Indeed, we can think of this derivative as a cross between worst-of digitals \\nand European or Asian style down-and-in call options for which the barrier observations are \\nbased on the worst performing stock, whereas the payoff depends on the basket performance. \\nNote that this structure is adapted to a bullish view on the stocks composing the underlying \\nbasket. \\n15.2 HIMALAYA \\nThe Himalaya is a type of growth product that is usually linked to a basket of n shares or \\nindices S1,S2,..., Sn . In the literature these are discussed by Overhaus (2002). The structure \\npays a coupon at maturity, based on the arithmetic average of the performance of the nb best \\nunderlying assets in each speciﬁc period during the term of the product. Once a share or index \\nhas been selected as one of the best performers in a particular period, it is then removed from \\nthe basket for all subsequent periods. At each observation date ti (i = 1,..., N ), the nb best \\nperforming stocks in the basket are removed from the latter for subsequent periods and their \\nperformances are frozen. Note that the basket at time ti is composed of n − nb × (i − 1) assets. \\nThe Himalaya option payoff at maturity T is given as: \\n1 Himalaya payoff = Participation × max 0, Running Perf( T ) − K n \\nwhere K is  the strike price and \\nnb j )/summationdisplay S( \\nRunning Perf( ti ) = Running Perf( ti −1) + ti\\nj )S( \\nj=10 \\nj)Note that Running Perf(0) = 0 and S( is the spot price of the j th best performing stock in ti \\nthe basket at time ti . \\nIn the e xample shown in Figure 15.3, the holder buys a 4-year Himalaya note that is capital \\nprotected and offers him an unlimited proﬁt potential. The underlying basket is composed of \\nfour sector indices. At the end of each year, the best performing underlying is removed from \\nthe basket and its performance is frozen, i.e. locked in. At maturity, the holder receives 100% of \\nUnderlying basket 4 sector indices \\nTenor 4 years \\nCurrency USD \\nNotional $ 1,000,000 \\nStrike 100% \\nObservations (frequency) Annual \\nStrike 100% \\nParticipation 120% \\nNote 100% \\nCapital protected Ye s \\nFigure 15.3 The terms of a Himalaya structure. 234 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n90% 100% 120% \\n110% \\nFigure 15.4 Scenario showing the returns of four underlying sector indices as well as the freezing \\nmechanism process of the Himalaya structure. \\nits investment plus a participation of 120% in the positive arithmetic average of the four frozen \\nperformances. For example, the Himalaya can be structured on various sectors, so that it freezes \\nthe performance of a speciﬁc sector when it is performing well, locks in this performance and \\ngives time to other sectors to perform later. Another example we see in Chapter 19 on hybrids \\nuses the Himalaya across different asset classes to pick up the different cycles between the \\nasset classes. In Figure 15.4, we see a scenario showing the underlying sector indices’ returns \\nas well as the freezing process behind the Himalaya concept. It is important to keep in mind \\nthat the best performances are only observed at the end of each period. At the end of the fourth \\nyear, the investor receives 100% of his invested capital plus 120% participation in the frozen \\nbasket. Here, the arithmetic average of the frozen performances is equal to 112.57% and the \\nstrike price is equal to 100%. Therefore, the Himalaya note pays the buyer an amount equal \\nto $1,150,800, which corresponds to 100% plus 1.2 × 12.57% of the notional. \\nHimalayas are quite  popular because investors can earn an unlimited proﬁt on a structure \\nthat looks like a best-of structure. The Himalaya option is adapted to a bullish view on the \\nunderlying assets composing the basket. The seller of this option has a short position on the \\nunderlyings’ forwards, and will need to buy Delta in each of the underlying assets; he is long \\ndividends and long borrowing costs. However, the option sensitivities with respect to volatility \\nand correlation are much less trivial. \\nLet’s take the  example shown above to determine the answer. The idea is to consider the \\nHimalaya option either as a series of best-of options or as a series of worst-of options. Indeed \\nwe can regard this Himalaya option as a series of best-of options having respective maturities \\nof 1, 2, 3 and 4 years, knowing that the options based on best performing stocks have a lower \\nmaturity. On the other hand, we can consider this Himalaya option as a series of worst-of \\noptions having respective maturities of 4, 3, 2 and 1 years, knowing that the options based on \\nworst performing stocks have a higher maturity. Because of the maturity effect, the worst-of \\nimpact is more important than the best-of impact. This means that we should look at this \\nHimalaya option as a series of worst-of options. The seller of the option, as this conclusion \\nimplies, is long dispersion which is a long position on asset volatility and a short position on \\ncorrelation between the different sector indices. \\nHowever, this is  not always the case. Now let’s consider a 4-year maturity Himalaya option \\nbased on 10 underlying stocks. Like an Asian option, the Himalaya is a call on the average \\nperformance of the best stocks within the basket. At the end of each year, the best performing /bracketleftbigg /bracketrightbigg /parenleftbig /parenrightbig \\n/bracketleftbigg /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg 235 Mountain Range Options \\nstock is removed from the underlying basket and its performance is frozen. The option holder \\nreceives the positive arithmetic average of the frozen performances. In this case, the Himalaya \\noption is considered as a series of best-of options since the frozen performances are respectively \\nthe performances of the best performing stock out of 10, 9, 8 and 7 stocks. A trader selling this \\noption is then short dispersion, which means that he is short volatility and long correlation. \\nTherefore, the V ega as well as the correlation sensitivity depends on the contract speciﬁed. \\nIt is also interesting to note that this structure is the ﬁrst one to replicate a strategy from \\nthe management of mutual funds, where one typically sells the stocks in a portfolio that \\nhave performed best each year. Indeed, when a stock performance is frozen, the seller of \\nthe Himalaya gets rid of it since it no longer has any impact on the payoff. More modelling \\ndetails are discussed in the section below on pricing mountain range products. We also revisit \\nHimalayas in the context of hybrid derivatives in Chapter 19. In this context, the underlyings \\nare selected from different asset classes, and the Himalaya thus provides an excellent way to \\nbeneﬁt from the different cycles of the different asset classes, locking in returns. \\n15.3 EVEREST \\nThe Everest structure typically gives the holder, at maturity, a minimum of 100% of the sum \\ninvested in addition to a bonus linked to the worst performing stock from a basket of assets. \\nThe maturities of the Everest structure tend to be quite long, possibly greater than 10 years, \\nand the basket has a large number of assets, typically greater than 10. The holder of an Everest \\nnote receives the following payoff at maturity T : \\nEverest payoff = Notional × Coupon + min Ret j (T )\\nj=1,..., n \\nwhere Ret j (T ) = Sj (T )/Sj (0) − 1. When investing in an Everest note, owing to the nature of \\nthe payoff, capital is guaranteed, and it is interesting to note that the coupon can have a value \\ngreater than 200%. While this presents an attractive feature for the investor, the seller must be \\ncautious when risk-managing this product and we discuss the associated risks below. \\nConsider an in vestor who wants to invest $10 million in a 100% guaranteed capital structure \\nthat offers an attractive payoff linked to a basket of shares on which he is bullish. He can \\ninvest in a 10-year Everest structure associated with his basket of 11 international “Blue Chip” \\nstocks that gives a payoff at maturity of 200% plus the positive or negative performance of the \\nworst-of between initial date and maturity date. Or equivalently \\nS1(T ) − S1(0) S11(T ) − S11(0)Notional × 200%  + 100% × min S1(0) ,..., S11(0) \\nIn Figure  15.5,  we can see four scenarios showing the returns of the worst performing \\nstock at maturity. Table 15.1 clariﬁes the payoff scenarios of the Everest structure according \\nto the four cases drawn in Figure 15.5. For instance, the performance of the worst-of in \\nthe ﬁrst scenario at the end of the tenth year is equal to 34.26% of its initial level. This \\nmeans that the holder of the Everest structure receives a unique payment at maturity equal to \\n200% + (34.26% − 1) = 134.26% of the notional. This corresponds to an annualized rate \\nof return equal to 2.99%. As we can see through the different case scenarios, Everest can \\npotentially offer an unlimited investment performance as the underlyings are usually chosen \\non the basis of consistent growth potential. For instance, if the worst performing stock shows 236 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n0% \\nSeries 1 Series 2 Series 3 Series 4 50% 100% 150% 200% \\nFigure 15.5 Four scenarios showing the worst performing stock returns in a basket of 11 underlying \\nassets. \\na zero percent performance after 10 years, the investor could get twice his initial investment, \\nwhich is equivalent to 7.18% annualized rate of return. The worst case scenario for an investor \\nwould correspond to the spot of one of the underlying stocks ﬁnishing with no value. Then \\nthe investor receives a ﬁnal payment equal to 200% + (0% − 1) = 100%, which shows that \\n100% of the capital is guaranteed. \\nAs for the  risks associated with trading Everest options, the payoff is based on the worst \\nperforming stock; lower stock forward prices imply lower potential payoff. Therefore, a trader \\nselling Everest notes is short the forwards, and will need to buy Delta in each of the underlying \\nassets on day 1, and adjust dynamically through the life of the trade to remain Delta neutral. \\nHe is short interest rates and long the dividends and borrowing costs. On the other hand, \\na higher dispersion decreases the level of the worst performing stock. The seller of Everest \\nstructures is long dispersion, that is, long volatility and short the correlation, between the stocks \\ncomposing the underlying basket. More details are discussed below in the section regarding \\npricing mountain range options. \\n15.4 KILIMANJARO SELECT \\nThe Kilimanjaro Select structure is a type of multi-asset Growth and Income product since it \\npays the note holder ﬁxed periodic coupons C, most of the time higher than the market rate \\nof interest, as well as a ﬁnal coupon at maturity depending on the performance of the shares \\nthat constitute the heart of the underlying basket. Throughout the life of the note, the worst \\nTable 15.1 Payoff scenarios for a 10-year Everest note based on 11 international Blue Chips.

At maturity, \\nthe basket is composed of n − m shares where m stands for the number of removed shares. \\nUltimately, the m best performers composing the basket at expiry date are also removed from \\nthe underlying basket. The remaining (n − 2m) shares that constitute the ﬁnal basket Basket f \\nare the so-called heart of the basket. Note that the performances of the underlyers are computed \\nwith respect to the initial date of the structure, and the nature of the asset-removing process \\nagain makes this a dispersion trade. The note holder of the Kilimanjaro Select receives the \\nfollowing payoff at maturity: \\nKilimanjaro payoff (T) = Notional × Basket f (T) − K \\nwhere K is  the strike price and \\n1 n−2m /summationdisplay Sf, j(T)Basket f (T) = n − 2 mj=1 Sf, j(0) \\nHere Sf, j(T) is the spot price at maturity of the jth share composing the heart of the basket. \\nIt is also  interesting to understand that this structure is not capital protected. Indeed, the \\nﬁnal basket can have a negative performance, which can imply a negative rate of return. \\nTake an in vestor who wants to put £10 million in a 6-year Kilimanjaro Select note. An \\ninvestment bank is willing to sell him this structure with the following features: \\nr At the end of each year and until maturity, the holder receives a ﬁxed coupon equal to \\n£600,000, which  corresponds  to 6% of the note notional. r The underlying basket is composed of 10 stocks. At the end of each year, the worst \\nperforming stock is removed from the basket. This process is continued until the end of \\nthe fourth year. Four years after the initial date, the underlying portfolio is composed of \\nsix remaining stocks. At maturity, after observing the returns of the remaining underlying \\nshares, the four best performing stocks are removed from the basket. Let Share f,1 and \\nShare f,2 denote the two remaining stocks that constitute the heart of the underlying portfolio. r At maturity date, the note holder receives a ﬁnal coupon depending on the performance of \\nthe ﬁnal basket:  \\n1 Sf,1(T) Sf,2(T)Notional × + 2 Sf,1(0) Sf,2(0) \\nwhere Sf,i(t) is the spot price of share f,i at time t . \\nIn Figures  15.6  and 15.7, we can see two separate scenarios showing the returns of the \\nunderlying stocks throughout the life of the note described above. These graphs empha-\\nsize the stock  selection mechanism of the Kilimanjaro Select. Indeed, the solid lines repre-\\nsent the returns  of the shares that constitute the ﬁnal basket. Table 15.2 clariﬁes the payoff \\nof the Kilimanjaro structure according to the cases drawn in Figures 15.6 and 15.7. In the \\nﬁrst scenario, the ﬁnal level of the two shares that compose the ﬁnal baskets are equal to \\n111.11% and 115.93%, which makes the payoff at maturity equal to 113.52% of the notional. \\nAnd since the note holder receives six annual ﬁxed coupons of 6%, this makes the annual rate \\nof return equal to 6% + (113.52%1/6 − 1) = 8.14%. In the second scenario, the stocks that \\nconstitute the heart of the basket underperformed and their ﬁnal levels are equal to 58.98% and 238 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n50% 100% 150% 200% Scenario 1 \\nFigure 15.6 Scenario 1 showing the returns of the underlying stocks as well as the stock selection \\nprocess of the Kilimanjaro Select structure. \\n72.62% of their initial spot. Therefore, the Kilimanjaro Select pays the buyer a ﬁnal amount of \\n£6,580,000, which is 65.80% on the notional.

The percentage of protected capital is equal \\nto the sum of the coupons received (here 36%) which constitute a ﬁxed income no matter how \\nthe underlying stocks’ returns behaved. \\n15.5 ATLAS \\nThe Atlas note is a capital guaranteed multi-asset product. Indeed, this growth structure makes \\na unique payment at maturity T where the holder receives 100% of the invested capital plus \\na variable coupon linked to the basket of n assets S1,S2,..., Sn , and computed as follows. \\nAt maturity, the n1 worst performing stocks as well as the n2 best performers are removed \\nfrom the underlying basket.

Using what we have learned through \\nthe earlier discussions, the ﬁrst risk to think about is the Delta. One must take into account \\nany digital risk involved in these options and base a price on the ability to Delta hedge large \\ndigitals. Recalling the discussions of hedging digitals, the liquidity of the underlying assets \\ncomes under question, and the option’s price must reﬂect the cost of hedging. 240 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n50% \\n0% 100% 150% 200% \\nFigure 15.8 Scenarios showing the returns of the underlying stocks as well as the stock selection \\nprocess of the Atlas structure. \\nThe complicated multi-asset nature of these products means that it is unlikely that one can \\nﬁnd closed form solutions. Even if we had closed formulas for the fair values of these options \\nunder Black–Scholes assumptions, these formulas would be almost totally useless because \\nmountain range options are notoriously sensitive to skew, and using a ﬂat volatility would lead \\nto serious mispricing. Thus, although we assume that the pricing method will have to involve \\na Monte Carlo simulation, the question is: Which model do we need to simulate? \\nBecause these  payof fs are quite skew dependent, the bare minimum we need is a skew \\nmodel. Given the multi-asset nature of these products we would need to calibrate to the skews \\nof each of the underlying assets. The dates to which we want to calibrate will be at least those \\nthat have a signiﬁcance to the payoff (for example, the dates where the Himalaya’s underlyings \\nare assessed and the best are removed). Ideally, we want to have a smooth calibration through \\ntime, with emphasis on the calibration on these dates (so as to not over smoothen the calibration \\noverall at the cost of the ﬁt being of lower quality at these points). Our ability to do so will \\ndepend on how good our skew model is. The signiﬁcant dates will serve as maturity dates for \\nvanilla options that can be used to hedge the Vega and possibly the Gamma (if too large) of \\nthese options. The prices of these vanillas must thus be reﬂected in the calibration of the model, \\nin order for these exotic products to correctly show risk against them, and allow them to serve \\neffectively as hedging instruments. Vega hedges will need to be rebalanced depending on how \\nthe markets move and the relative dispersion on the underlying assets’ prices – meaning that \\nthe seller will have to adjust their Vega dynamically as the market moves, and the price must \\nreﬂect the cost of hedging. \\nAssuming that we  need skew, the simplest thing would be to look to a local volatility model. \\nIn the case of mountain range options however, we ﬁnd that these models fall short, and we will \\nin fact need to price and compute hedge ratios for these options using a stochastic volatility \\nmodel. Why is this? In the previous two chapters regarding cliquets, we had explicit forward \\nskew risks that needed to be priced, as well as Vega convexities. In the case of mountain \\nrange options, though we do not have explicit forward skew risk as we have with cliquets, \\nthese options are extremely sensitive to the implied smile dynamics of the model. A stochastic 241 Mountain Range Options \\nvolatility will also allow us to pick up any Vega convexities that also need pricing, although \\nthe main concern is smile dynamics. \\nSo what  do  we know about smile dynamics? We explicitly saw in Chapter 13 that local \\nvolatility models do not generate forward skews, and can thus not be used for products with \\nexplicit forward skew dependence. Local volatility models are, in the case of mountain range \\noptions, also not useful, particularly because the smile dynamics generated by local volatility \\nmodels are not realistic, and in fact these dynamics can be the complete opposite of what we \\nobserve in the market. By smile dynamics we refer to the phenomena of how the skew moves \\nas the underlying moves: if the underlying moves in one direction, how should the skew move? \\nWe already touched upon this in the discussion of lookback options in Chapter 14, and saw the \\nconcepts of sticky strike and sticky Delta in regards to movements in the skew. The lookback, \\nand also the range accrual that can be regarded as a set of forward starting digitals, do not \\ncarry explicit forward skew, but will be sensitive to how the skew moves as the underlying \\ndoes. In the case of mountain range options, it is key that we use a model with correct smile \\ndynamics, and to this end we must use a stochastic volatility model. \\nDiscussions about  smile  dynamics in the literature appear in the context of models such as \\nthe SABR model of Hagan et al. (2002) in which this particular ﬂaw in local volatility models \\nis pointed out, and the need for a stochastic volatility model emphasized in order to obtain \\ncorrect smile dynamics. Wrong smile dynamics have a serious impact on the prices and hedge \\nratios, and because of the complicated nature of the mountain range payouts – particularly the \\nsensitivities to implied volatility skews as we move through time – our price will be off, as \\nwill our hedge ratios (drastically!) if we have the wrong dynamics. We see the SABR model \\nin more detail when we discuss interest rates in Chapter 17, and although this model is not \\nthe best suited for equities, the concept of smile dynamics it raises is equally serious in the \\ncontext of these exotic equities. \\nIn these  e xotic options, it is important to understand how the Vegas change with respect \\nto other parameters. We already know about Vega convexity from Chapter 13, and this is the \\nsensitivity of Vega w.r.t. volatility. Vanna, on the other hand (another higher order Greek), is \\nthe sensitivity of Vega to a move in the underlying’s price. This is represented by the cross term \\ninvolving the cross derivative of the option’s price w.r.t. the volatility and to the underlying’s \\nprice. As the spot changes, how does this affect our Vega? This is Vanna. In a mountain range \\noption, and particularly when an underlying’s path can result in it being removed from the \\nbasket, we expect the Vega to be sensitive to a movement in the underlying. While stochastic \\nvolatility models know about Vega convexity, they also allow us to price this Vanna term. Vega \\nhedges for mountain range options can be very unstable, and the cost of dynamically adjusting \\nthem must be reﬂected in the price. In Appendix A, section A.3, we discuss more technical \\ndetails and see why these terms appear in the pricing equation under stochastic volatility. \\nOther than these  issues, the multi-asset nature of these products introduces correlation risk. \\nAll these payoffs are multi-asset and are thus sensitive to the correlations between the various \\nunderlyings. More importantly than knowing that this risk exists is the fact that, in mountain \\nrange options, it can be particularly pronounced. For example, the Altiplano option has high \\ncorrelation sensitivity that is much higher than a basket option’s sensitivity. \\nThese correlations  must  be correctly speciﬁed and computed by the criteria laid out in \\nChapter 7. However, in the case of some mountain range options, for example the Himalaya, \\nthe option’s correlation sensitivity to a correlation pair can change near or at the monitoring \\ndate. From a day 1 pricing perspective, one can ﬁrstly monitor whether the seller is short or \\nlong the various correlation pairs and take a spread over or below the computed correlation 242 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nlevels. Additionally, because this may change, the trader will most likely be unable to hedge \\naway this risk entirely, if at all, and a margin should be taken for any residual risks. \\nThe stochastic  v olatility process for each underlying will need to be correlated with each \\nother, and we face problems with the calibration of the volatility to volatility processes. \\nRecall that the stochastic volatility model has two sources of randomness, one from the \\nunderlying asset’s price being modelled as a random variable and the second from the volatility \\n(or variance), which is also random. The question arises: How do we calibrate, or at least \\nmeaningfully interpret, the correlations between two volatility processes? This can be done by \\nsimply taking a conservative value to use in the pricing, depending on their effect on the price, \\nor avoided all together. The more important correlations to worry about are those between the \\nprocesses for the underlying assets’ prices. A realistic modelling approach would be to use \\ncopulas to connect the independently calibrated processes of each underlying asset. Copulas, \\nwhich are discussed in detail in Chapter 20, offer a way of having a joint distribution, consistent \\nwith each underlying’s distribution, and offer a range of rich correlation structures. 16 \\nV olatility Derivatives \\nNever swap horses crossing a stream. \\nAs the name implies, volatility derivatives have payoffs that depend explicitly on the volatility \\nof the underlying assets on which they are written. These payoffs are designed to provide the \\ninvestor with a way to take a direct and clean view on volatility, whether for speculation or \\nhedging purposes, without being exposed to movements in the underlying. There is now a \\nliquid OTC market for products such as the variance swap, and we have also seen the rise of \\nvolatility indices, such as the CBOE’s VIX, which is used as a measure of the implied volatility \\nof the S&P 500 index options. There is a lot of literature on the subject of volatility derivatives \\nand we refer to these contributions as we develop the various aspects of the chapter. \\n16.1 THE NEED FOR VOLATILITY DERIV ATIVES \\nOne aspect of the demand for such products comes from the generally negative correlation \\nthat is often seen between an index (or stock) and its volatility, as discussed in Chapter 4 on \\nvolatility and skew. This negative correlation makes a volatility product an excellent choice for \\ndiversiﬁcation, especially in the light of the recent increase in the correlations among assets \\non a global level. As we saw, volatility generally increases as the market declines, and being \\nable to directly buy volatility as a downside hedge deﬁnitely has appeal. This demand has been \\nmet with supply from the sell side in certain contracts, particularly the variance swap. This is \\nattributed to the existence of robust hedges for such contracts, and today there exists a liquid \\nOTC market for variance swaps on major indices. \\nFollowing the v ariance swap, investors’ appetites have increased for more tailored views \\nand we saw the emergence of a new generation of volatility derivatives such as corridor and \\nconditional variance swaps, Gamma swaps and options on realized variance. One can also \\nnow trade futures and some options on the volatility indices. In addition to these, one can \\nbuild structures using what we know about volatility derivatives combined with some of the \\nprevious payoffs we have seen. V olatility derivatives can be tailored to hedge speciﬁc volatility \\nrisks and can also be customized investments in volatility. With the increase in the liquidity \\nand range of products, it is fair to consider volatility derivatives as an asset class of their own. \\n16.2 TRADITIONAL METHODS FOR  TRADING VOLATILITY \\nHere we review some of the strategies seen before and study their potential (or lack thereof) as \\na means to trade volatility. Essentially we streamline the analysis to show that the traditional \\nmethods do not provide a pure exposure to volatility, justifying the necessity for the variance \\nswap and subsequent volatility derivatives. Traditional methods revolve around Delta-hedged \\noptions in the sense that by hedging the exposure to movements in the underlying one can \\nisolate volatility exposure. One buys (sells) options whose implied volatility is less (greater) \\nthan the anticipated realized volatility. 244 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nFirst let’s consider the case of a straddle. As we saw in Chapter 6, the (ATM) straddle is a \\ncombination of an ATM call and an ATM put, and since the buyer (seller) of both the call and \\nthe put is long (short) volatility, the buyer (seller) of a straddle is long (short) volatility. Thus \\nthe straddle provides a method for the investor to take a view on the future realized volatility \\nof the underlying, and also on changes in implied volatility. \\nThe initial  Delta  of a straddle is close to zero, but as the underlying moves, the trade will \\nbegin to pick up Delta, and can incur high transaction costs and liquidity issues while keeping \\nthe straddle position Delta neutral. In order to see only the volatility risk, we would have to \\nconsistently Delta hedge the position to approximately remove the risk to movements in the \\nunderlying’s spot price. In addition, given that both the call and the put are at-the-money, the \\ninitial cost in going long a straddle can be quite high. This method can be made cheaper by \\nbuying strangles, but with strangles one would need the underlying to move by a larger amount \\nin order to make money. Recall that the strangle is the combination of an OTM call and an \\nOTM put. Sadly, neither of these provide a pure exposure to volatility. \\nIn the case  of a regular call option, if the investor is able to Delta hedge away the underlying \\nprice risk, then a large proportion of the P&L from this strategy comes from the difference \\nbetween the volatility the underlying realizes throughout its life and the volatility used to price \\nand hedge the option. \\n/integraldisplay T \\n2P&L = [V(S(0),σ i) − V(S(0),σ h)] erT + er(T−t) /parenleftbig \\nσh − σ2/parenrightbig S(t)2 \\n/Gamma1(t,σ h)dtt 2 0 \\nwhere σi is the implied volatility that was used to price the option; σh is the volatility that the \\ntrader uses when computing her Delta; and /Gamma1(t,σ h) is the Gamma of the option at time t \\ncomputed using the volatility σh, as discussed by Carr and Madan (1998). As we saw \\nin the discussion of Gamma in section 5.2 (in particular the discussion of Figure 5.7 on \\npage 73), the Gamma of a vanilla at a time t prior to maturity is a function of the level of the \\nunderlying. Thus, the above integral implies that this P&L is still a function of the path of \\nthe underlying and the transition of time. An additional drawback is that a call option’s Vega \\ndecreases when the underlying moves away from the strike in either direction. This lowers the \\nmethod’s potential as a way to gain exposure to volatility, without taking a view on the path \\nof the underlying. The upshot of this is that we need a vehicle that will provide pure exposure \\nto the volatility of the underlying irrespective of its path, and one that does not require Delta \\nhedging. \\n16.3 V ARIANCE SW APS \\nThe variance swap allows the investor to obtain a pure exposure to the volatility of the \\nunderlying, unlike Delta-hedged options which still have path dependency. Variance swaps \\npay the difference between the future realized variance of the price changes of the underlying, \\nand some prespeciﬁed strike price that we label as Kvar. Its fair strike at inception is determined \\nby the implied volatility skew, but its ﬁnal payout is a function of the realized variance. It thus \\nallows one to take a clean view on the levels of implied volatility being high or low relative \\nto the expected realized volatility. Also, because of its nature as a pure volatility product, it \\nserves as an excellent vehicle for speculation on volatility and also as a hedging instrument. /summationdisplay /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg \\n/parenleftbig 245 V olatility Deriv atives \\n16.3.1 Payoff Description \\nThe\\n variance is  deﬁned as the annualized variance of log stock returns, and the strike price \\nKvar of the variance swap is referred to as the variance swap rate. At inception, this strike is \\nchosen to be the fair variance strike so that the present value of the swap is zero, that is, one \\nenters into a variance swap with no initial cashﬂow. \\nDifferent types  of  variance swap contracts can be speciﬁed, but daily log-returns are typically \\nused, based on the closing price of the underlying. The realized variance RV0(T )o rs i m p l y \\nRV( T ) between time t = 0 and time T is given by \\nRV( T )  = ANA\\nln2 S(ti ) (16.1)S(ti −1) NE i =1 \\nwhere A is the annualization factor, typically set to 252 in contracts, representing the number \\nof trading days per year (generally the number of sampling points per year); NE is the expected \\nnumber of sampling points given by the number of trading days; and NA is the actual number \\nof trading days where 0 = t0,t1,..., tNA = T between time t = 0 and T . The numbers NA \\nand NE will coincide as long as there are no market disruptions, but although NE is known \\nand speciﬁed at the outset, the payoff at expiry will have to be a function of the actual number \\nof days NA. As such, we have quoted realized variance in annual terms over the life of the \\ncontract [0,T ]. It is imperative that these speciﬁcations are clear in the term sheet of the \\ncontract and that scenarios such as trading being halted mid-session are covered. The payoff \\nof the variance swap at expiry is given by \\nVariance Swappayoff = RV( T ) − K 2 /parenrightbig \\n· Nvar \\nwhere K is quoted as the square root of variance. For example, a 320 variance strike K 2 \\nvar \\nwould be denoted by Kvar = 17.89 so that this can be interpreted in volatility terms. N is the \\nnotional of the variance swap and, like other swaps, this is the amount on which the payoff is \\ncomputed without this amount ever changing hands. That is, the payoff at expiry is the above \\ndifference which is settled in cash, however, some intermediate payments may be speciﬁed, \\ndepending on counterparty risks. \\nFor a v ariance swap this notional is known as the variance notional, and is speciﬁed in \\nterms of a volatility notional (Vega); for example, $100,000 per Vega or volatility point. The \\nstandard practice for determining the variance notional, N , appearing in the above payoff, is \\ncalculated as \\nV olatility Notional N = (16.2)2 × Kvar \\nThe reason for doing this is so that a one-point move in realized volatility is approximately \\nequivalent to the variance swap payoff moving by the speciﬁed volatility notional. Using the \\nexample so far, the variance notional in this case is $100,000/(2 × 17.89) = $2,795, and the \\nholder of this variance swap receives $2,795 for every point by which the realized variance \\nRV( T ) exceeds the strike price K 2.var \\nOne thing to note is that the deﬁnition of realized variance here differs from the usual \\nstatistical deﬁnition seen in Chapter 4 on volatility, as in this case we have not subtracted the \\nmean when computing the variance that we assume here to be zero. This makes the payoff \\nof the variance swap additive in the sense that a 6-month variance swap can be split into two \\n3-month variance swaps. /parenleftBig /parenrightBig /radicalbig 246 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n16.3.2 Variance vs Volatility Swaps \\nAt ﬁrst it  may seem strange to see a discussion of volatility swaps within that of variance \\nswaps, since a volatility swap should allow the investor to directly trade the volatility (and not \\nthe variance) of the underlying asset. However, the variance swap is the more popular product \\nowing to several advantages over the volatility swap. A volatility swap is deﬁned much the \\nsame way as the variance swap, only the ﬂoating part of the volatility swap is the square root \\nof realized variance. \\nV olatility Swappayoff (T ) = RV( T ) − Kvol · N \\nSo, in f act, it is a forward contract on the future realized volatility of the underlying. Again one \\ncan deﬁne the fair strike for a volatility swap, the fair volatility, so that the swap’s present value \\nis zero at the start. At expiry, the holder of a volatility swap receives (or pays) the difference \\nbetween the realized volatility and the prespeciﬁed volatility swap strike, times the notional \\namount. \\nSo why is  the demand for variance swaps greater? Simply put, variance swaps are a much \\nmore natural hedging instrument. Taking the example of the Delta-hedged call, it is the variance \\nthat appears in the P&L formula, not the volatility. Keep in mind that variance is scaled by \\ntime, giving it an additive property (Carr and Madan, 1998), whereas volatility, which is the \\nsquare root of variance, loses this property of linearity. Consider the following trade: we buy \\na variance swap with a 2-year maturity, and sell a variance swap with a 1-year maturity. This \\nallows us to take a view on the expected 1-year variance in 1 year’s time. This is in fact one \\nway of trading forward variance using variance swaps. Or, assume that we enter into a 2-year \\nvariance swap and in 1 year’s time decide to unwind the position, we can simply at that point \\nin time take the opposite side in a 1-year swap thus completely offsetting the original position. \\nThese are possible due to the additive property of variance swaps, which a volatility swap \\nlacks. \\nAnother reason,  no w for the seller of a variance or volatility swap, is that there exist robust \\nreplication strategies for variance swaps. As we will see in the next section dealing with \\npricing, there are model-independent results that allow for the replication (and thus pricing) \\nof a variance swap but only approximate formulas exist for volatility swaps. Again it is the \\nlinear property of the variance swap that allows for the development of such formulas and the \\nnon-linearity of the volatility swap that causes problems. \\nOne can apply  a model, for example Heston’s stochastic volatility but this requires specifying \\nthe dynamics of the volatility. The advantage of this is that one can value both of these in \\nclosed form (see section A.3.1 in Appendix A), however, such pricing does not necessarily \\nenlighten us on how to hedge these contracts. All in all, volatility swaps are less useful as \\nhedging instruments, and are also more difﬁcult to price making the variance swap the more \\npopular product in equity markets. \\n16.3.3 Replication and Pricing  of Variance Swaps \\nTo value a  variance swap one must evaluate the portfolio that replicates it, and the value of fair \\nvariance is the initial cost of such a portfolio. In the literature, related work on this dates back \\nas far as Neuberger’s paper (1990). The rise of the variance swap can be largely attributed to the \\nfact that it can be robustly replicated, thus both priced and hedged, using a linear combination \\nof European options and a dynamic position in futures. Since the replicating portfolio consists /parenleftbigg/integraldisplay /integraldisplay 247 V olatility Deriv atives \\nof vanilla options, one does not need speciﬁc modelling assumptions to ﬁnd the fair value. \\nAs long as we can trade European options on an underlying along enough strikes, and with \\nthe same maturity as the variance swap, and can also trade futures, then we can replicate the \\nvariance swap on this underlying. \\nThe variance sw ap can be replicated by a portfolio of long positions in OTM options for \\nall strikes (zero to inﬁnity) weighted by the inverse of the square of the individual strikes \\nplus a dynamically adjusted forward position in the underlying. Since the replication portfolio \\ncontains European options, the valuation at inception is sensitive to changes in the implied \\nvolatilities of these options. Thus we must make sure that whatever model we do use ultimately \\nknows about the implied volatility skew and prices these Europeans correctly. Given we require \\na full range of strikes, one must be cautious when calibrating the skew in the wings as these \\nhave an impact on the pricing of the variance swap, particularly so on the downside. \\nWritten explicitly, the  price of the variance swap is the sum of the components of the \\nreplicating portfolio given by \\n/bracketleftbigg /parenleftbigg/parenrightbigg /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg 2 Variance Swap( T  ) = rT − ln FT − S(0)erT − 1 T S(0) FT \\n∞ FT dK dK /parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg \\nrT+ eK 2 Put( K , T ) + K 2 Call( K , T ) \\n0 FT \\nwhere FT is the ATM forward (Demeterﬁ et al., 1999) The ﬁrst term is the cost of rebal-\\nancing the position  in the underlying, the second is a short position in a log contract paying \\nln (FT /S(0)) at expiry. The third is a short position in 1/FT forward contracts struck at FT , \\nand the two integrals are the long position in strips of OTM puts and calls respectively with \\na weighting of 1/K 2. This replication is made possible by applying the result of Breeden \\nand Litzenberger (1978), that, with some assumptions, any twice differentiable payoff can be \\nreplicated using a strip of European options. \\nIn practice, the sum of the two integrals is approximated discretely as \\nn /summationdisplay Put( Ki , T ) N /summationdisplay Call( Ki , T ) \\nK 2(Ki − Ki−1) + K 2(Ki − Ki−1) (16.3) \\ni=1 i i =n i \\nwhere we have discretized the set of strikes over which we take the strip of options. In the \\nabove price of the variance swap, the term FT could have actually been speciﬁed to be another \\nvalue, but the forward is a good place to switch from calls to puts (indeed OTM options \\nare more liquid). As for volatility swaps, although approximations do exist, there is not a \\nsimilar model-independent result. See Appendix A, section A.3.1, about Heston’s model as \\nan example where one can price both volatility and variance swaps when one has made a \\nmodelling assumption. \\nFrom a theoretical  point of view, these formulas allow for the replication of variance swaps, \\nbut from a practical point of view, some problems can arise. We require a whole strip of \\nEuropean options, and although we may be able to get these for indices, they are not generally \\navailable for single stocks. One could use American options on stocks to get the values of \\nEuropean options to resolve this problem, but we will still have the problem of not being able to \\nﬁnd quotes for listed options for all the required strikes. If we apply the approximation involving \\nthe sums and lack a speciﬁc strike, it is possible to use a form of arbitrage-free interpolation \\nbetween two strikes to obtain the required value, and possibly also the extrapolation of deep \\nOTM implied volatilities. Recall section 6.5 regarding the requirements for arbitrage freedom /radicalbig \\n/radicalbigg \\n/bracketleftbig \\n/bracketleftBig /bracketrightBig /parenleftbig /parenleftbig /parenrightbig+ \\n/parenleftbig 248 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nof an implied volatility skew. Since the replication requires an entire strip of options, executing \\nthe hedge can be quite expensive in terms of transaction costs, and in fact accounting for the \\naforementioned problems can at least partly explain the difference between the theoretical \\nvalue of a variance swap and the OTC market quotes. \\nNote that the  above formulas do not contain a correction for dividends. One can modify the \\nway the variance is computed to adjust for dividends to come and account for the jump in the \\nstock price due to the dividend payments. Owing to the uncertainty of future dividends, one \\nshould take precautions. \\nWe can get  a quick price for the fair strike of a variance swap, and if we assume that the \\nskew is linear in strike, an approximation is given by \\nKvar ≈ σATMF 1 + 3T × (Skew)2 (16.4) \\nwhere σATMF is the ATM forward volatility, T is the maturity, and Skew is the slope of the \\nimplied volatility skew, as appearing in Demeterﬁ et al. (1999), and more recent market \\nresearch articles such as Bossu et al. (2005). If we assume that the skew is log-linear of \\nthe form σ(K ) = σATMF − β ln (K /F) where F is the forward price, which is a much more \\nrealistic parameterization, we can use the following approximation \\nβ2 /parenleftbig /parenrightbig \\n12σ2 \\nATMF T 2 Kvar ≈ ATMF + βσ3σ2 \\nATMF T + 4 ATMF T + 5σ4 \\nwhere σATMF is the at-the-money forward volatility, T is the maturity, and β is the slope of the \\nlog skew curve. This takes account of the convexity in the implied volatility skew, as opposed \\nto the assumption that it is just linear. However, both these approximations lose accuracy when \\nthe skew is steeper. \\n16.3.4 Capped Variance Swaps  \\nConsider the v ariance swap in the event of the underlying defaulting. The variance as deﬁned \\nabove will shoot to drastic levels in such an event, and so being short a variance swap could \\nresult in an unlimited loss. For this reason variance swaps, on single stocks in particular, are \\noften capped. Not only does this take care of the potentially huge downside, but it also reduces \\nthe contribution of the deep OTM puts for which there is limited liquidity. Recall that this is \\none reason for a discrepancy in the market quotes vs the theoretical value. A typical cap would \\nbe at 250% of K 2 \\nvar, and the payoff of the capped variance swap is given by \\nCapped Var Sw appayoff = min RV( T ), 2.5K 2 /bracketrightbig \\n− K 2 \\nvar var  \\nMoving around some terms, this is equivalent to \\nRV( T )  − K 2 /parenrightbig \\n− RV( T  ) − 2.5K 2 \\nvar 1{Default } var var  1{No Default }+ 2.5K 2 \\nNotice that the term RV( T ) − 2.5K 2 /parenrightbig+ is the payoff of an OTM call option on realized var \\nvariance. By imposing caps on variance swaps, the sellers of such contracts have essentially \\nbought OTM calls on realized variance, as discussed in Overhaus et al. (2007). This has \\nspurred the development of a new set of volatility derivatives: options on realized variance, \\ndiscussed below in section 16.5. /summationdisplay /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg 249 V olatility Deriv atives \\n16.3.5 Forward Starting  V ariance Swaps \\nIn a forw ard starting variance swap the variance is calculated between two future dates T and \\nT /prime (T is the start date and T /primethe maturity). Here the forward starting realized variance is given \\nby \\nForward Starting  R V(T ) = 252 N \\nln2 S(ti ) \\nN S(ti −1)i=n \\nwhere T =tn ,tn+1,..., tN =T /prime are the trading days between T and T /prime . \\nFrom a pricing  perspective, the forward starting variance swap is the calendar spread of two \\nvariance swaps with the correct notionals, starting at time t =0 and with respective maturities \\nT and T /prime. This is possible thanks to the additive property of the variance swap, as pointed out \\nby Carr and Madan (1998), and thus the forward starting variance swap is not more difﬁcult \\nto price and hedge than the regular variance swap (albeit there are two swaps now) and the \\ncontract itself provides the investor with an instrument to trade future volatility. \\n16.3.6 Variance Swap  Gr eeks \\nThe variance sw ap is the answer to obtaining volatility exposure without being exposed to the \\npath of the underlying. The Gamma of the variance swap at time t is \\n2 1 /Gamma1var swap(t ) = · T S (t  )2 \\nwhich means that the cash Gamma /Gamma1cash =/Gamma1 ×S(t )2/100 is actually constant. That is, the \\ncash Gamma of a variance swap is not a function of the price of the underlying or time, meaning \\nthat it has a constant cash Gamma that depends only on the replicating portfolio’s initial value. \\nThis is in line with the idea behind the variance swap that the level of the underlying does not \\nimpact the P&L from a position in a variance swap. Essentially, once one sets up the replicating \\nportfolio, the derivation of Greeks will follow. For more on their derivation see Demeterﬁ \\net al. (1999). \\nThe Vega of  a variance swap is given by \\n2 Vvar swap(t) = σ(T −t )T \\nwhich is linear  in volatility σ. The second derivative with respect to volatility shows the \\npositive Vega convexity seen in variance swaps. The variance Vega (sensitivity to the variance \\nσ2)i sg i v e n b y \\nT −t Wvar swap(t) = T \\nThis is saying  that the sensitivity of the variance swap to variance itself is equal to 1 at time \\nt =0 and is equal to zero at maturity T . This makes perfect sense as at time t =0 the variance \\nswap, by construction of the payoff, should have a one to one sensitivity to variance. \\nThe Theta  of  the variance swap is \\nθvar swap(t) =− 1 σ2 \\nT /summationdisplay /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg 250 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nwhich also stays constant over time (it is not a function of t ). Therefore the variance swap \\nbleeds time value at a rate proportional to variance, and at maturity, it has bled exactly σ 2:t h e \\ninitial variance. \\nCombining the Theta  and Gamma, as seen in section 5.6 in Chapter 5 on Greeks, we see \\nthe same classic result of Black–Scholes theory \\n12θ + /Gamma1 S2σ =0 2 \\nthat the decrease in the option’s value through time (Theta) is offset by positive Gamma. \\nFrom the setup of the replicating portfolio, as skew increases, the value of the variance \\nswap increases (the fair strike increases) meaning that the seller of the variance swap is short \\nskew. One can obtain an approximate skew sensitivity by using the approximation in equation \\n(16.4). \\n16.4 V ARIATIONS ON V ARIANCE SW APS \\nAs we saw, variance swaps are an excellent way to trade volatility and we have understood \\nthe demand for this product as well as the reasons for the willingness to supply such prod-\\nuct. While  in vestors have grown used to this product, the appetite has grown for similar \\ncontracts that offer a more tailored exposure to volatility. The next generation of products dis-\\ncussed here include  corridor variance swaps, conditional variance swaps and Gamma swaps. \\nThese allow investors to target speciﬁc exposures to the implied volatility skew and the term \\nstructure of volatility, and can also be used as vehicles for dispersion trading. Additional \\nmotivation for such products comes from the need to resolve some of the aforementioned \\nproblems involving hedging variance swaps, and to also offer better prices than traditional \\nvariance swaps do. We discuss these three products under this section as they all have the \\ndistinct advantage of having replication portfolios similar in nature to the variance swap albeit \\ndifferent. 16.4.1 Corridor Variance Swaps\\n  \\nAs the name  implies, corridor variance swaps pay realized variance when the underlying is \\nwithin a corridor, let’s call this corridor or range [L , U ]. That is, when computing the realized \\nvariance to be used in the ﬁnal payout of the swap, one only includes returns when the under -\\nlying is within  the prespeciﬁed range, the rest are taken to be zero. In the literature, pioneering \\nwork on corridor variance swaps has been done by Carr and Lewis (2004), speciﬁcally the \\nwork on replication formulas. \\nThe (corridor)  realized variance to enter into the ﬁnal payout of the swap is given by \\nCorridor RV(T  ) = 252 N \\n1{L<S(ti −1)≤U }ln2 S(ti ) \\nN S(ti −1)i=1 \\nSpecifying a corridor allows the investor to gain exposure to the volatility of an asset that \\nis contingent on its price. Immediately it is clear that this is a generalization of the variance \\nswap since, taking L =0 and U =+ ∞ , the underlying is always within the range and we get \\nthe payoff of the usual variance swap. We can also see that because of the speciﬁcation of a 251 V olatility Deriv atives \\ncorridor, the fair strike of the corridor variance swap is always less than (or equal to in the case \\nabove) that of the corresponding regular variance swap. Like the variance swap, payment is \\nmade at maturity, and the corridor variance swap is struck at its fair strike, which again means \\nthat there is zero cost to enter into the swap. \\nTwo popular  types  of corridor variance swaps are the up-variance and the down-variance \\nswaps. An up-variance swap is a corridor variance swap where the lower bound of the corridor \\nis some ﬁxed number L and the upper bound is +∞. In contrast, the down-variance swap \\nhas a corridor from a bound U down to zero, that is, over the range [0, U ]. Being careful \\nabout some details, which we discuss below, it makes sense that a down-variance swap plus an \\nup-variance should equal the regular variance swap. So if we can price an up-variance swap \\n(with range [L , +∞)), we know that the corresponding corridor down-variance swap is given \\nby the difference between a regular variance swap and an up-variance swap. Also, one can \\ndeﬁne the corridor variance swap with corridor [L , U ] as the difference between two corridor \\nup-variance swaps, with lower bounds L and U . \\nThese two corridor  variance swaps allow the investor to take views on the implied volatility \\nskew. Consider an investor who believes that the implied volatility skew will steepen; he can \\ntake a view on this by buying a down-variance swap and selling an up-variance swap. Also the \\nopposite position would allow a view on the ﬂattening of the skew. Since the implied volatilities \\nof OTM puts are generally greater than the OTM calls, the ATM corridor down-variance will \\nbe more expensive than the ATM corridor up-variance. Thus the cost of entering such trades \\nis a function of the bound (where the down-variance ends and the up-variance starts) and the \\nview one takes. A corridor down-variance swap can be used as a hedge for market crashes, but \\none must note that the contribution of a daily return to the payout is contingent on the previous \\nday’s close being in the range. Thus, if a crash occurs in one day (the price going from a level \\noutside the down-variance corridor to a level within it) it will not contribute to the accrued \\nrealized variance. \\nThe replication  portfolio  for a corridor variance swap is similar in weighting to the variance \\nswap, but the strip of European options needed is restricted to the speciﬁed corridor of the swap; \\nwith some adjustments. This means that the number of options needed for the static position is \\nless and the hedge thus cheaper and easier to execute. For example, an up-variance swap does \\nnot have exposure to the strike region of deep OTM put options that cause problems in the case \\nof the usual variance swap and impact the price. One can tailor a corridor variance swap around \\na speciﬁc view on the path of the underlying and gain exposure to volatility where required \\nand for a better price than a simple variance swap. The condition that L < S(ti −1) ≤ U ,i n \\nparticular the “less than or equal” in the computation of corridor realized variance is what \\nallows this additive property. For the replication formulas of corridor variance swaps we refer \\nthe reader to Carr and Lewis (2004) where the problem of corridor variance replication is \\ntackled. 16.4.2 Conditional Variance\\n  Swaps \\nSimilar to corridor  variance swaps, conditional variance swaps have a payoff contingent on \\nthe underlying being within a speciﬁed corridor. However, when computing the variance in \\nthe case of the conditional variance swap, any variance accrued outside the corridor is not \\ncounted; that is, the variance accrued is divided by the total number of days the underlying \\nspends in the corridor, in contrast to the corridor variance swap in which such returns are /summationdisplay /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg 252 \\ni Exotic Options and Hybrids \\ncounted as zero and the returns are summed up and divided by the total number of trading \\ndays. The conditional realized variance is given by \\nConditional RV(T  ) = /summationtextN 252 N \\n1{L<S(ti −1)≤U } ln2 S(ti ) \\n=1 1{L<S(ti −1)≤U } S(ti −1)i i =1 \\nwhere [L , U ] is the speciﬁed corridor. The sum appearing in the denominator, /summationtextN \\n=1 1{L<S(ti −1)≤U }, is always less than N .I ti se q u a lt o N when the underlying never leaves \\nthe range, and in this case the payoff is exactly that of the regular variance swap. \\nThis speciﬁcation  is  what separates the conditional variance swap from the corridor variance \\nswap and can be interpreted ﬁnancially as follows: If an investor is long a corridor variance \\nswap, then he is at risk that the underlying trades outside the corridor. He thus accrues less \\nrealized volatility since the amount accrued is divided by the total number of trading days. \\nWith a conditional variance swap, however, these returns are not considered at all and if the \\nunderlying trades outside the corridor this is reﬂected in the denominator, which only counts \\nthe days spent inside the range. This means that the investor is purely exposed to the volatility \\naccrued in this range. So the risk lies in the underlying trading within the corridor, at a low \\nvolatility. The investor is essentially taking a view on the path of the underlying’s price falling \\nwithin a range, as well as what the volatility of the underlying will do in such a range. In the \\nconditional variance swap, the amount of time spent in the range is not as important as the \\nsame consideration for a corridor variance swap, as here a key consideration is knowing what \\nthe underlying will do once in such a range. \\nTo illustrate  this  point, consider the example of a holder of a corridor variance swap and a \\nconditional variance swap, both with range [L , U ] and maturity 6 months. Assume, though an \\nextreme example, that the underlying only spends 2 days in the range. The corridor variance \\nswap has a very low variance since whatever the underlying did in these 2 days, the total \\nvariance will be divided by 126 (number of trading days in 6 months). In contrast, the ﬂoating \\npart of the conditional variance swap is the sum of the variance accrued on these 2 days divided \\nby 2 (number of days in the range), a big difference. So the conditional variance swap is more \\nabout what the underlying does once in this range, and in the example here the payoff can be \\nlarge or small depending on what it does during these 2 days inside the range. \\nAs with corridor  variance swaps, there exist conditional down-variance swaps and condi-\\ntional up-variance sw aps. The conditional down-variance swap can be used as a hedge against \\na market crash, but as with the corridor variance swap, the underlying has to be in the corridor \\nat the previous day’s close for a return to contribute – meaning that it does not accrue if the \\ncrash occurs in one day. A conditional down-variance allows the investor to take a view on \\nthe levels of volatility in the event of the market declining. For example, if we consider an \\ninvestor who believes that if the market does decline it will do so with a lot of volatility, then \\ngoing long a conditional down-variance swap is a good way to express this. As before, one \\ncan bet on the steepness of the skew by taking opposite positions in conditional up-variance \\nand conditional down-variance swaps. The conditional variance swap can again be replicated \\nand involves only Delta hedging after the initial static hedge. For a discussion of replication \\nformulas for conditional variance swaps, we refer the reader to the product note (Allen et al., \\n2006). /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg 253 V olatility Deriv atives \\n16.4.3 Gamma Swaps \\nAs\\n we sa w, the variance swap has a constant cash Gamma, that is, the Gamma exposure is \\nnot a function of the underlying’s price. The Gamma swap is a variance swap whose notional \\nis proportional to the level of the underlying, and is designed to have a constant Gamma. \\nIn contrast to the variance swap that has a constant cash Gamma, this is thus useful for the \\ninvestor who thinks in terms of units of the underlying and not the cash value of such units in \\nthe portfolio. The payout has the same features as the variance swap, but the realized Gamma \\nvariance used to compute the payoff is given by \\n/summationdisplay S(ti ) 252 NA\\nln2 S(ti )Gamma RV(T  ) = S(t0) S(ti −1) NE i =1 \\nwhich makes it immediately clear that the Gamma swap introduces an exposure to the under-\\nlying’s level not seen in the variance swap. That is, the exposure of the Gamma swap to the \\nunderlying’s price means that it is exposed to the correlation between the underlying’s price \\nand its volatility. \\nThe ﬁrst adv antage over a variance swap is seen in the case of a default: as the stock price \\ndrops to zero, the realized Gamma variance does not shoot to inﬁnity. As the stock price \\nS(ti ) appearing in the term S(ti )\\\\S(t0) in the above sum goes to zero, it takes the entire term \\nappearing in the sum to zero. This characteristic of Gamma swaps means that there is no need \\nto impose caps in order to handle this eventuality. At the expense of introducing exposure \\nto the underlying’s level, the Gamma swap dampens the weight on large downward moves \\n(which have large positive square returns). Therefore the Gamma swap should have a lower \\nfair strike than the corresponding variance swap, reﬂecting the fact that it generally has lower \\npayoffs. \\nMuch like the  variance swap, one can replicate, and thus price and hedge, the Gamma swap \\nusing a strip of European options. The fair strike of a Gamma swap, KGamma swap,a tt i m e t = 0, \\nis given by \\n2 e2rT /bracketleftbigg/integraldisplay FT dK /integraldisplay ∞ dK /bracketrightbigg \\nKGamma swap = T S(0) Put( K ,  T ) + Call( K , T ) \\n0 K FTK \\nThat is to  say, the Gamma swap can be replicated by a continuous strip of puts and calls, each \\nweighted by the inverse of the relevant strike.1 As before, FT is the ATM forward, and these \\nintegrals will have to be approximated by a sum resembling that of equation (16.3). This is \\ndifferent to the weights of the variance swap, which are the square of the inverse of the strikes. \\nThus the weighting on the deep OTM puts is reduced, making the Gamma swap easier to \\nhedge with respect to the corresponding variance swap. \\nOne can trade  the implied volatility skew by taking positions in Gamma and variance swaps. \\nFor example, consider the investor who believes the skew will decrease (ﬂatten), this view \\ncan be played by going long a Gamma swap and short a variance swap. When hedged, a \\ncombination as such sets the investor short downside variance and long upside variance, and \\nthis can be reasoned as follows: if the market drops, we pick up negative Vega (the variance \\nswap generally pays more than the Gamma swap), but if the market goes up, we pick up \\n1 Proven by applying the result of Carr and Madan (1998). More discussions on Gamma swaps can be seen in Lee \\n(2008) and Overhaus et al. (2007). /bracketleftbig \\n/bracketleftbig \\n/bracketleftbig /bracketleftbig 254 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\npositive Vega (the Gamma swap here pays more than the variance swap). Gamma swaps can \\nalso be used as a tool for dispersion trading, discussed below in section 16.7. \\n16.5 OPTIONS ON REALIZED V ARIANCE \\nAs investors have adapted to using variance swaps, options with realized variance as the \\nunderlying have emerged. A call option on the realized variance has payoff \\nCall on R V payoff (T ) = N × max 0, RV( T ) − K 2/bracketrightbig \\nand likewise the put option on  realized variance \\nPut on R V payoff (T ) = N × max 0, K 2 − RV( T ) /bracketrightbig \\nwhere RV(T  ) is the realized variance of an asset between time t = 0 and time T , given by \\nequation (16.1), and K 2 is the strike price. N is the notional amount, speciﬁed in currency \\nunits per variance point. \\nSince realized  v ariance can potentially reach quite high levels, the seller may want to impose \\na cap on realized variance before its inclusion in such a payoff. Specifying the cap in terms of \\nvolatility points, the payoff is \\nCall on Capped  RVpayoff (T ) = max 0 , min Cap2 , RV( T ) /bracketrightbig \\n− K 2/bracketrightbig \\nAlthough the v ariance swap and some of its variations have the distinct advantage that they \\nare replicable in a model-independent manner, the option on realized variance, along with \\nthe volatility swap, does not have such formulas. This means that to price these options one \\nhas to specify a model, although under some assumptions one can ﬁnd useable formulas: \\nCarr and Lee (2007), under the assumption of a symmetric skew,2 show that one can ﬁnd \\nreplication formulas for options on realized variance. We also refer the reader to the paper by \\nSepp (2008), in which the analytical pricing and hedging of options on realized variance are \\ndiscussed assuming Heston’s stochastic volatility model with jumps. \\nOption payof fs  involving realized variance are convex in volatility, and when a model must \\nbe used to value them in the absence of a replication strategy, then stochastic volatility models \\nare a natural choice. The Vega convexity coefﬁcient, i.e. the vol-of-vol parameter, plays an \\nimportant role in such payoffs, because depending on the type of option and the trader’s \\nposition, they can be long or short vol-of-vol to a large extent. \\nThe variance sw ap itself can serve as a part of the set of hedging instruments for such \\noptions, since its payoff is linear in realized variance. If variance swaps are to serve as hedging \\ninstruments, then variance swap curve calibration is also a requirement so that the model \\nshows risk against these instruments. Transaction costs of any possible dynamic hedge must \\nbe factored into the price. \\n16.6 THE VIX: VOLATILITY INDICES \\nThe VIX is the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) V olatility Index which measures \\nthe implied volatility of the S&P 500 index. It is commonly used as a measurement of the \\nmarket’s expectation of short-term volatility and, speciﬁcally, it estimates the implied volatility \\n2 A smile, meaning zero correlation between the underlying and the volatility. /parenleftbigg \\n/parenleftbigg 255 V olatility Deriv atives \\nof the S&P 500 over the coming 30 days. For this reason it is sometimes referred to as the fear \\nindex: a high VIX level implies low conﬁdence in the market, and vice versa. It is computed \\nin real time using a weighted average of options on the S&P 500 across strikes, and thus it \\nincorporates information about the skew. This is known as the new VIX as there was a previous \\nVIX that used only ATM options and was thus not as informative (see Carr and Wu, 2006). A \\nformal reference for the VIX is the CBOE’s ofﬁcial documentation (CBOE, 2006). \\nThe idea behind  such an index is that it can be replicated by a portfolio of options that will \\nnot be affected by movements in the underlying, but only by movements in volatility. In fact, \\nthe VIX is an approximate quote for the fair strike of a variance swap on the S&P 500 index \\nwith maturity T \\n⎡ ⎤ \\nK\\n 2 2erT \\n⎣/summationdisplay /Delta1Ki /summationdisplay /Delta1Ki 1 FT /parenrightbigg2 \\n= T Ki ≤FT Ki 2 Put( Ki ) + K 2 Call( Ki )⎦ − − 1VIX T K 0Ki >FT i \\nwhere K0 is the ﬁrst strike below the forward index level FT , and the term \\n1 FT /parenrightbigg2 \\n− − 1 T K 0 \\nhelps to improve the accuracy of this approximation. The choice of the variance swap, but not \\nthe volatility swap, is for the same reasons discussed earlier in the chapter – in particular, the \\nexistence of a model-independent replication strategy. \\nThe VIX is  quoted in terms of percentage points as VIX = 100 × KVIX. Since it is not \\nquoted in a dollar amount there are not ETFs or other liquid instruments that track the VIX \\nlike traditional equity indices. However, there are futures and traded derivatives on the VIX; as \\nof 2004, it has been possible to trade CBOE V olatility Index (VIX) futures. The typical contract \\nsize is $1,000 times the VIX, and is cash settled on the ﬁnal settlement date. These provide an \\nexcellent tool to trade implied volatility independently of the level of the underlying, whether \\nfor hedging purposes, diversiﬁcation or speculation. \\nSimilar volatility e xists on other indices, for example the VSTOXX which is the Dow Jones \\nEuroStoxx 50 volatility index, on which futures are also traded. The same applies to the new \\nVDAX, and the VSMI volatility index of the SMI. \\n16.6.1 Options on the  VIX \\nIn 2006  the  CBOE introduced options on the VIX, and so far there are call options, put options \\nand even digital options. These provide tools for the investor to take views on the level of the \\nVIX, much the same as a traditional call option allows on an index or stock. For example, \\nassume that the VIX has been at relatively low levels as the market has been climbing, and that \\n6-month VIX futures are also pointing to expected low levels. For an investor who believes \\nthat this will change over the next 6 months, and that the VIX will rise, a call option on the \\nVIX is an easy way to express it. If the VIX does rise, this will realize a proﬁt for the investor, \\nbut with the traditional payout of a call option this can potentially end OTM and have zero \\npayoff. After the market crash of the 2008/09 crisis, the VIX hit unreached levels, and options \\non the VIX would allow one to express a view that the VIX would decrease. \\nIn the light  of the negative correlation between the S&P 500 and the VIX, using options \\non the VIX one can form the following views: The investor who is bearish on the S&P and \\nbullish on the VIX can go long VIX futures or long call options or call spreads on the VIX, /summationdisplay /summationdisplay 256 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\ndepending on whether or not she wants the optionality feature. For the investor who is bullish \\non the S&P 500 and bearish on the VIX, a short position in VIX futures or a long position in \\nVIX put options or put spreads would ﬁt. A call option on the VIX can also be used as a hedge \\nfor the investor against a large downward movement in the S&P 500. \\n16.6.2 Combining Equity  and  Volatility Indices \\nConsider an equity  portfolio to which we add volatility as a diversifying asset. The negative \\ncorrelation that exists between equities and their volatilities can be utilized to form payoffs that \\nbeneﬁt from both increases in equities but also increases in volatility during market declines. \\nFirstly, consider an equity index, for example the S&P 500 index, and its volatility index, the \\nVIX; and, secondly, decide on the type of payoff in which one is interested. Forming a basket \\nof the S&P 500 and the VIX, one will ﬁnd a low overall volatility because of the large negative \\ncorrelation between the two. Some form of rainbow payoff at maturity can be formed, the \\nextreme case being a best-of option. \\nIn order  to  capture the negative correlation between these two we will need to settle on a \\nreasonable frequency for the observations: for example, quarterly observations. The payoff at \\nmaturity can use the average returns of each of these, computed using the frequency dates. The \\nfrequency of the observations will have an impact on the price, and is one degree of freedom if \\nstructuring such an option with price constraints. The second degree of freedom is the rainbow \\nweights, 80% and 20% for example, corresponding to the best-of the two and the worst-of \\nthe two, respectively (these are 100% and 0% in the case of a best-of payoff). This is just one \\nexample of how one can beneﬁt from volatility as an additional asset class. \\n16.7 V ARIANCE DISPERSION \\nRegarding an index as a basket, we can write the variance of the index as the weighted sum of \\nthe constituents’ volatilities and pairwise correlations: \\n2 2σI = wi σ 2 + 2 wiw jσiσ jρij i \\n1≤i≤n\\n 1≤i< j≤n \\nwhere n is the number of constituents. Assuming that we knew the values of, and were able to \\ntrade, the variances on the left-hand side and the variances (and volatilities) on the right-hand \\nside, then the only remaining factors in this equation are the pairwise correlations. To this \\nend, trading options to implement a strategy of gaining exposure to these correlations, by \\ntrading all other components of the equation, will incur the same issues we saw in section 16.2 \\non traditional methods for trading volatility. However, if one makes use of the advances in \\nvolatility trading vehicles, this simpliﬁes things by removing the need for Delta hedging and \\nallowing one to gain direct exposure to the volatilities. \\nWhen variance sw aps are used in this fashion this is known as a variance dispersion trade. \\nBy going short variance swaps on each of the individual components of an index and long \\na variance swap on the index itself, one obtains a long position in correlation. The notionals \\nof each of the variance swaps must be chosen so that the trade is Vega neutral, and we know \\nthe Vegas of each of these. It does not necessarily have to be an index, it can be a basket, \\nand all one needs is the ability to trade a variance swap on the basket and on its individual \\ncomponents. One can almost replicate the payoff of the correlation swap of section 7.5.2 by \\ntrading Vega neutral variance dispersion, (see Bossu, 2005), though not perfectly. 257 V olatility Deriv atives \\nVariance dispersion can be used by a sell-side derivatives desk that is structurally short \\ncorrelation – as the result of the sale of many multi-asset structures – in order to buy back \\nsome of this correlation. Although it will not replicate the correlation swap exactly, it is the \\ncase that correlation swaps between single stocks are very liquid, whereas there is a market \\nfor variance swaps on the components of major equity indices. \\nThe Gamma  sw ap is actually the best vehicle to use in the case of variance dispersion, \\nbecause the proportion of an individual asset in the basket increases when its value increases, \\nas discussed by Roger Lee (2008). If we recall, the variance weighting in the Gamma swaps \\nincreases linearly in the underlying’s price, making it ideal for the variance dispersion trade. \\nThe reason  for  the use of spreads of index vs components variance or Gamma swaps as \\nsuch to gain correlation exposure is because of the transparency they give. The fact that \\nthey provide a purer exposure to volatility than traditional methods (such as straddle trading, \\ndiscussed above) means that when such a trade is in place one can see their P&L from the trade \\nclearly, for example, if the trade has made ﬁve correlation Delta points. In addition, trades \\ninvolving variance swaps can be easily unwound as we saw, and this can add to the appeal of \\nsuch a strategy. Part IV \\nHybrid Derivatives and \\nDynamic Strategies 17 \\nAsset Classes (I) \\nEverything has its beauty but not everyone sees it. \\nConfucius \\nA hybrid derivative is a multi-asset derivative whose underlyings do not belong to the same \\nasset class. The structures introduced in previous chapters are focused around equities, although \\nmuch of the analysis regarding structuring and risk analysis can be extended to other asset \\nclasses. In the case of hybrids we again have to think about the effects of volatility and \\ncorrelation. On the side of volatility, different asset classes have different volatility structures \\nand can have very different implied volatility skews compared to equities. Also, the different \\nasset classes have different futures and forward curves. The issues of liquidity and transaction \\ncosts also arise and must be understood for each asset class. \\nIn this and  the next chapter on hybrid derivatives we present these other asset classes and \\nexplain the intricacies in each of them. By describing the markets, the forward curves, the \\nvanilla derivatives and then some exotic derivatives that exist in each, we can then translate \\nthis understanding to combine these asset classes with each other in a meaningful manner \\nin Chapter 19. Understanding these asset classes will also allow us to extend all the analysis \\ndone so far on various structures to all the asset classes, individually, and ultimately combined. \\nThe chapters on hybrid derivatives also provide us with tools for tackling dynamic strategies \\ninvolving multiple asset classes in Chapter 21. \\nThe most  ob vious motivation for the use of hybrids is that products structured on multiple \\nasset classes can provide a valid source of diversiﬁcation. While we have already seen volatility \\nas a valid diversiﬁer for an equity portfolio owing to its negative correlation with equity, we \\ncan also ﬁnd low correlations, if not negative correlations, among the other asset classes. \\nCorrelation structures are discussed in Chapter 19 where we describe some examples of \\nmacro-economic views that can be structured into hybrid derivatives and used for purposes of \\ndiversiﬁcation or yield enhancement. \\nOther than equities,  we discuss the following major asset classes: \\n1. Interest Rates \\n2. Commodities \\n3. Foreign Exchange  (FX)  \\n4. Inﬂation \\n5. Credit \\nHybrid derivatives enable  an investor to take a view on combinations of these asset classes \\nwhether for speculative purposes or even as a hedging strategy for multi-asset class exposures. \\nThis chapter covers interest rates and commodities and Chapter 18 covers FX, inﬂation and \\ncredit. 262 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n17.1 INTEREST RATES  \\nWe have already touched upon interest rates in Chapter 1 when we discussed basic instruments. \\nIn this section we go into more detail, in particular with respect to the aspects of interest rate \\nderivatives that we will later use to construct multi-asset derivatives. The section will cover \\nforward rate agreements and swaps, explaining constant maturity swaps (CMS). We discuss \\nbonds, yield curves and interest rate swaptions. This leads us to a discussion of the SABR \\nmodel that is now a market standard in interest rate derivatives. The section ends with a \\ndiscussion of some popular interest rate exotics. \\nThis section  is  by no means a comprehensive discussion of interest rate derivatives; it is \\ndesigned to arm us with the knowledge and tools that are necessary to understand hybrid \\nderivatives, although much more can be said. The interest rate products described here are \\nstandard, and for more elaborate discussions on interest rate markets and derivatives we refer \\nthe reader to Brigo and Mercurio (2006) and Rebonato (2002). \\n17.1.1 Forward Rate  Agreements \\nA forw ard rate  agreement (FRA) is an OTC contract that speciﬁes an interest rate that will \\nbe paid or received as part of an obligation that starts at a future date. The relevant dates and \\nthe notional amounts will also be speciﬁed in the contract. A typical contract involves two \\nparties exchanging a ﬁxed rate for a ﬂoating one equal to some reference rate that underlies the \\ncontract, typically LIBOR or EURIBOR. Payments are calculated on the basis of the notional \\namount, and it is the difference between the ﬁxed and ﬂoating legs that is ultimately paid. The \\nparty receiving the ﬂoating leg (who is paying the ﬁxed rate) is said to be long the FRA, and the \\nparty paying ﬂoating is short the FRA. These are important as a swap is a combination of FRAs. \\nLet Rref(t ) denote the reference rate at time t and Rﬁxed the ﬁxed rate. On the effective date, \\nTeff, the payment made by the FRA is the netted amount given by \\n(Rref(Teff) − Rﬁxed) · d FRA payoff (Teff) = Notional × 1 + Rref(Teff) · d \\nd is the  day count fraction, which is given by the day count convention of the relevant currency \\non which the FRA is written. It deﬁnes the number of days in the year over which interest \\nrates are calculated. As a fraction, for GBP this is typically 365, while for EUR and USD it is \\n360, and d is given by the number of days divided by 365 (or 360). \\nThe ﬁxed rate  Rﬁxed is the rate at which both parties agree. Both the ﬁxed and reference rates \\nare those that begin to accrue on the effective date Teff, and in turn are paid on the termination \\ndate of the contract. The discount factor, which is represented in the denominator, is speciﬁc \\nto the case where – because the payments are known on the effective date – they are paid on \\nsuch a date. \\nConsider a simpliﬁed  example to illustrate the contract where party A enters into an FRA \\nwith counterparty B such that party A will receive a ﬁxed rate of 3% for 1 year on a notional \\namount of $10,000,000 in 2 years’ time. Party B will receive a ﬂoating rate, the 1-year LIBOR \\nin this example, which is determined in 2 years’ time on the effective date. The same notional \\napplies to the 1-year LIBOR rate prevailing at that point in time and is used to compute the \\nnet payments needed to be made. \\nIn 2 years’  time, according to the FRA contract, and assuming that the 1-year LIBOR is \\n3.2%, which is higher than the agreed ﬁxed rate of 3%, party A who is paying the ﬁxed portion 263 Asset Classes (I) \\nwill have to make a net payment of (3.2% − 3%) × Notional = $20, 000 to party B. Here we \\nignored the day count fraction and did not discount. \\nThe reference  rate  to be used in computing the net payment depends on the difference \\nbetween the effective date and the termination date. For example, if the FRA has an effective \\ndate in 3 years and termination date in 3.5 years, then the USD 6-month LIBOR rate would \\nbe speciﬁed in the FRA contract. Similarly, an FRA with an effective date in 4 months and \\ntermination date in 5 months would use the USD 1-month LIBOR rate. \\n17.1.2 Constant Maturity  Swaps \\nAn interest  rate  swap is an OTC instrument in which two counterparties agree to exchange \\na stream of interest payments for another stream of cashﬂows. In a typical ﬁxed for ﬂoating \\ninterest rate swap, one party makes payments based on a reference rate (the ﬂoating leg of the \\nswap) in exchange for the other party making payments based on a ﬁxed rate (the ﬁxed leg of \\nthe swap). The ﬁxed rate in such a swap is computed so that the swap has a net present value \\nof zero at initiation, and, as such, the ﬁxed rate is called a swap rate. \\nThese swap rates  form the swap rate curve, also known as a swap curve or LIBOR curve. This \\ncurve must be related to the zero coupon yield curve. The swap curve gives the relationship \\nbetween swap rates at different maturities. In some cases, particularly in emerging market \\ncurrencies, where sovereign debt is not liquidly traded, a swap curve can sometimes be more \\ncomplete, and can thus be the better indicator of the term structure of interest rates in such \\ncurrency. \\nConsider a sw ap, of maturity T , between two counterparties: A will pay a ﬁxed interest rate \\non a notional in currency C, and B will pay the ﬂoating leg on the same notional in the same \\ncurrency C, indexed to reference rate. Party A pays ﬁxed and receives ﬂoating and is thus said \\nto be long the interest rate swap. For example, the swap can involve exchanges of cashﬂows \\non a quarterly basis where the ﬂoating leg is given by the prevailing 3-month USD LIBOR \\nplus a spread of 25 bp. \\nA constant  maturity  swap (CMS) is a swap in which the buyer is able to ﬁx the duration \\nof the cashﬂows he will receive in the swap. In the swap described above, the ﬂoating leg \\nis reset on a quarterly basis to the LIBOR rate prevailing at the time, whereas in a CMS the \\nﬂoating leg is ﬁxed against a point on the swap curve on a periodic basis. That is, the ﬂoating \\nleg is reset with reference to a market swap rate rather than a LIBOR rate. The second leg of \\nthe swap is typically a LIBOR rate but can be a ﬁxed rate or even another constant maturity \\nrate. Again the structure of these can be based on a single currency or as a cross-currency \\nswap. The value of the CMS depends on the volatilities of different forward rates and also the \\ncorrelations between them. As such, pricing a CMS requires an interest rate model or at least \\nwhat is known as a convexity adjustment (Brigo and Mercurio, 2006). \\nAs an e xample of a CMS, consider an investor who believes the 3-month USD LIBOR rate \\nwill fall with respect to the 5-year swap rate. To play this view the investor can go long the \\nconstant maturity swap that pays the 3-month USD LIBOR and receives the 5-year swap rate. \\nThe 5-year swap rate here can be speciﬁed to be a point even further down the curve, thus \\nallowing one to take a view on the longer section of the yield curve. The CMS thus also serves \\nas a tool for hedging exposures to the long end of the yield curve, and in the case above where \\nthe investor receives the 5-year swap rate, a CMS as such will hedge against a sharp increase \\nin this 5-year swap rate. 264 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n17.1.3 Bonds \\nContinuing the Chapter  1 introduction to bonds, we discuss here various types of bonds and \\nthen bond price sensitivities. A bond is a debt instrument in which the issuer will need to pay \\nthe holder interest, usually in the form of a coupon, and repay the notional on the maturity \\ndate of the bond. \\nGovernment Bonds  \\nWhen\\n a national  government issues a bond it is known as a government or sovereign bond, and \\nthese are denominated in the currency of the relevant country. Interest from some government \\nbonds is generally considered to be risk free, although there are cases where governments have \\ndefaulted on their sovereign bonds. In the US, Treasury securities, denominated in USD, are \\nthe least risky USD investments. \\nSuch bonds  may  carry a low default risk, but do carry other risks. For example, if an investor \\nbuys a 5-year Treasury bond in USD and receives interest plus her money back in 5 years, \\nthe notional amount received back may be worth less owing to depreciation in the USD w.r.t. \\nother currencies and also the risk of inﬂation. When we discuss inﬂation in the next chapter \\nwe see government issued bonds that are inﬂation-indexed and as such protect investors from \\nexposure to inﬂation. \\nBond Futur es \\nBond\\n futures,  which  are traded on a futures exchange market, are contracts in which the holder \\nis obliged to buy or sell a bond at a speciﬁcally agreed point of time in the future and for a \\nspeciﬁc price. Being traded on an exchange, these contracts are standardized and their trading \\nregulated. As with trading any future, we are exposed to price ﬂuctuations between the initial \\ntrade date and the exercise date of the futures contract. That is to say, the price of a bond can \\nﬂuctuate like anything else, and although a bond may be purchased and its interest payments \\nmay be safe, its price between the initial agreement of a futures contract and exercise date can \\nvary by a signiﬁcant amount. \\nBond Mark et Indices  \\nA bond  mark et index is a weighted index of bonds or other interest rate instruments. Like a \\nstock market index, a bond index is used as a method to measure the composite value of its \\nconstituents. As an index it can also serve as a benchmark for comparison with other bond \\nportfolios. However, bond indices are generally more complex than stock market indices and \\nharder to replicate. It is still possible, however, to replicate such an index using bond futures. \\nA Treasury bond index, for example, is a portfolio of outstanding Treasury bonds and notes. \\nFloating Rate Notes  \\nA ﬂoating  rate  note (FRN) is a bond in which the coupon varies according to a reference rate, \\nfor example LIBOR plus a constant spread. A typical FRN has quarterly coupons and, at each \\npayment date, the value of the reference rate is monitored and added to the agreed spread. For \\nexample, the quarterly coupon can be the 1-month USD LIBOR plus a spread of 30 bp. 265 Asset Classes (I) \\nInverse Floating Rate Note \\nAn inverse ﬂoating  rate note (IFRN) again offers a variable coupon, but in this case the coupon \\nhas an inverse relationship with a speciﬁed reference rate. An instrument as such is designed \\nto offer a higher coupon as the reference rate declines. The price of a typical bond is inversely \\nproportional to the interest rates used in computing its value – as rates go up the value of the \\nbond in the market goes down. The inverse ﬂoater is designed so that as short-term interest \\nrates fall, both the bond’s yield and value increase. The opposite holds for such a structure if \\nrates were to rise and the inverse ﬂoating rate note’s value would decrease accordingly. As an \\nexample of the formulation of the inverse ﬂoating rate: \\nFloating Rate =  6% − 2 × 6m USD LIBOR /bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright /bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright /bracehtipupleft  /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright \\nﬁxed rate gearing reference rate \\nBond Price Sensitivities \\nThe duration of  a ﬁnancial asset refers to the sensitivity of this asset’s price to a movement \\nin interest rates. In the context of bonds, duration is the percentage change in the price of \\nthe bond with respect to interest rates, i.e. the absolute change in the price w.r.t. interest \\nrates, divided by the current bond price. Duration is measured in years and is between 0 and \\nT years, where T is the maturity of the bond. For small movements in interest rates, duration \\ngives the ﬁrst-order effect, i.e. linear effect, as the approximation of the drop in price of the \\nbond with an increase of 1% per annum in interest rates. A bond with 10-year maturity and \\na duration of 5 would fall in price by approximately 5% if interest rates increased by 1% \\nper annum. \\nThe second-order  ef fect, or bond convexity, measures the sensitivity of the duration of \\nthe bond to a change in interest rates. This is used similarly to the way the Gamma of a \\nderivative, or book of derivatives, is used. If the duration of a book of bonds is low, but the \\noverall convexity is still high, then a movement in interest rates will have a large impact \\non the duration of the book. If that book has both low duration and convexity, then it is far \\nbetter hedged against large interest rate movements. The concept of Taylor series expansions \\ndiscussed at the start of Chapter 5 applies, and we can write the change in the price of a bond \\n/Delta1( P), where P =P(r ) is the bond price written as a function of (ﬂat) interest rates, in terms \\nof the ﬁrst- and second-order terms of the series: \\n/Delta1( P) C  =− D/Delta1(r  ) + (/Delta1( r ))2 \\nP 2 \\nwhere D is  the bond duration and C is the bond convexity. \\n17.1.4 Yield Cur ves \\nA\\n yield  curv e is a plot of the interest rate yields of bonds of different maturities versus these \\nmaturities, and yield curves are widely monitored. The bonds used to form a yield curve \\nmust all be of the same credit quality. For example, the highly looked at yield curve of US \\nTreasury securities of different maturities. The signiﬁcance of this yield curve is that owing \\nto the government’s inﬂuence in this curve it is often used to infer future information about \\neconomic growth. 266 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n3.0% 2.5% 2.0% 1.5% 1.0% 0.5% 0.0% \\n01 234 5 6 7 89 1 0 \\nFigure 17.1 A typical yield curve. The 3-month, 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, 5-year and 10-year rates \\nare plotted. Notice the upward-sloping nature of the curve as well as how this increase slows down as \\nmaturities get longer. \\nYield curves are typically upward sloping with the longer maturities accompanied by higher \\nyields, although this increase in yield by maturity slows down as the maturities increase (see \\nFigure 17.1). An upward-sloping curve generally reﬂects that the market expects higher interest \\nrates in the future. Because the Federal reserve controls short-term rates,1 an upward-sloping \\nyield curve indicates that the market believes Fed policy will be favourable to ﬁnancial markets. \\nThe steeper the yield curve, the more positive this is believed to be. \\nThe opposite  case,  where we see a downward-sloping yield curve, is when the short-term \\ninterest rates are higher than the longer term rates. This is also known as an inverted or \\nnegative yield curve. This type of yield curve reﬂects that there are market expectations for \\nlower rates in the future. This is primarily because high short-term interest rates can imply \\nthat the government is trying to slow down the economy. \\nWe may also  see a humped shape yield curve. Assume the hump peaks at the 2-year point, \\nthen such a curve will indicate that the market expects rates to rise over the next 2 years but \\nthen decline. \\nYield curves can  make parallel shifts, and this is when all the points along the curve rise \\n(or fall) by the same amount. This generally signals a change in economic conditions and \\nexpectations regarding inﬂation. We come across these when structuring macro-economically \\nmeaningful multi-asset options. A non-parallel shift of the yield curve is when the various \\npoints move by different amounts. \\nOne can structure  options to take a view on any of the yield curve shapes or moves, \\nspeciﬁcally the ﬂattening or steepening of the yield curve, and movements up and down in the \\nyield curve. One can also take a view not only on the slope of the yield curve but also on its \\ncurvature. With regards to the slope, one can have a yield curve option on the spread between \\ntwo rates on the yield curve corresponding to two different maturities. Based on how these \\nrates are chosen, the option will pay off when the yield curve either ﬂattens or steepens. \\n1 The Fed controls the federal funds rate. This is the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of \\nreserves. /bracketleftBig /bracketrightBig \\n/parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg 267 Asset Classes (I) \\nIn the example of the CMS above, receiving the 5-year swap rate for example in a constant \\nmaturity swap allows for the view that rates will rise in the future as a result of a steepening \\nof the yield curve. The opposite holds and one can pay the swap rate in a CMS with the view \\nthat the long-term swap rates will not end up as high as the market is currently implying through \\nthe yield curve. When an investor receives the 7-year CMS, for example, and pays a ﬂoating \\nrate of, say, LIBOR plus a spread, then the exposure is primarily to the slope of the yield curve \\nand not to its level. This means that such a structure is not sensitive to parallel shifts in the yield \\ncurve. 17.1.5 Zero Coupon,  LIBOR\\n  and Swap Rates \\nIn this subsection  we establish the relationships between some of the interest rate concepts we \\nhave seen so far. Firstly, the relationship between a zero coupon bond B(t ,T ) at time t and \\nmaturity T , and the instantaneous interest rate rt . \\n/integraltext T rs dst B(t ,T ) = E e− \\nHere we point out the difference between zero coupon bonds and discount factors. Discount \\nfactors are not random as we can always get the current discount factors D(T ) by stripping \\nthe yield curve (Hagan, 2003). D(T ) = B(0,T ) = today’s discount factor for maturity T . \\nHowever, zero coupon bonds B(t ,T ) will remain random until the present time reaches time \\nt . \\nThe\\n spot LIBOR rate at time t and maturity T is \\n1 − B( t ,T )L (t ,T ) = (T −  t )B(t ,T ) \\nin terms of bonds  B( t ,T ). \\nA forward LIBOR at time t , with expiry Ti −1 and maturity Ti ,i s \\n1 B ( t ,Ti −1)Fi (t ) = − 1 Ti − Ti −1 B(t ,Ti ) \\nThis is a  market rate, and is the underlyer of the forward rate agreement contracts discussed \\nabove. The Treasuries used to form a yield curve only have a ﬁnite number of maturities, \\nand to see the yield at a maturity for which no Treasury security is available one will have \\nto interpolate the yield curve. When doing so it should be checked that the forward rates \\ncomputed as described here are all positive to ensure that the interpolation of the yield curve \\nis arbitrage free. \\nA swap rate described  above can also be written in terms of bonds. Let Sα,β(t ) be the swap \\nrate at time t with tenor Tα,Tα+1,..., Tβ. \\nB(t ,Tα) − B(t ,Tβ)Sα,β(t ) = /summationtextβ \\n=α+1(Ti − Ti −1)B(t ,Ti )i \\nThis is a market rate and it underlies interest rate swaps discussed above. At time t these are \\nall known from the bond prices B(t ,T ). 268 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n17.1.6 Interest Rate Swaptions  \\nAn interest  rate  swap option (called a swaption) is an option that gives the holder the right \\nbut not obligation to enter into an underlying swap. Which leg of the swap the holder of a \\nswaption can potentially enter into is determined by the type of swaption: the owner of a payer \\nswaption has the right but not obligation to enter into a swap where they pay the ﬁxed leg and \\nreceive ﬂoating. A receiver swaption gives the opposite: the right but not obligation to enter \\ninto a swap where they pay the ﬂoating leg and receive ﬁxed. \\nSwaptions are O TC derivatives but there exists an interbank swaption market. Typically \\nswaptions are valued using Black’s model, and from the swaption market one can obtain \\nimplied swaption volatilities. One key difference between a swaption and an option on a stock \\nis that two swaptions of the same maturity (the option) can be on two swaps of quite different \\ntenors. So for swaption volatilities there are not only volatilities for swaptions of different \\nmaturities but also different volatilities for underlying swaps of different tenors. The dominant \\nfactor in the swaption market is the time to expiry of the swaption compared to the tenor of \\nthe underlying swap. \\nBlack’s model  (see  Black, 1976) is speciﬁcally designed to have as underlying a forward \\ncontract on a swap – a forward swap rate. Instead of having a call option on a spot rate, we \\nhave a call option on a forward rate. In 1976 Black applied this model to price calls and puts on \\nphysical commodities, forwards and futures, and applying it to the case of European swaptions \\nthe underlying is a single forward swap rate: \\nCall Option price = e−rtset [ f N (d1) − KN (d2)] \\nPut Option price = e−rtset [KN (−d 2) − f N (−d 1)] \\nwhere f is  the current underlying forward rate and K is the strike price. The values of d1 and \\nd2 are \\nlog f/K ±  1 σ 2 \\n2 Btexp d1,2 = √ σBtexp \\nThis resembles the Black–Scholes formula but has some key differences, in particular, \\nforward prices exhibit a different form of randomness to spot prices. In the above formula the \\ndiscount factor is taken between time zero and the settlement date tset. The time parameter used \\nin computing d1 and d2, which in turn gives the value inside the brackets, is the expiry date texp. \\nThe volatility σB will be chosen from the swaption implied volatilities in the market. \\nTypically in the swaption market there are ATM swaption implied volatilities for various \\nswaption maturities and various tenors of the underlying swaps. A swaption is quoted by the \\nmaturity of the option, the tenor of the swap, whether the swap is a receiver or payer swap, \\nthe strike and the implied volatility. For example, a 1 into 2 receiver at 5.4% for 16.8%. The \\n1-year represents the maturity of the option, the 2-year is the tenor on the underlying (receiver) \\nswap, the option is struck at 5.4% and has an implied volatility of 16.8%. \\nUsing an A TM volatility to price an OTM European swaption would require an adjustment \\n(Figure 17.2). Black’s model is popular because it is extremely fast, and recently we saw the \\nemergence of the SABR model that is the simplest extension of Black’s model that accounts \\nfor skew and has decent implied dynamics. To manage a book with potentially thousands of \\nswaptions, speed is a key factor, and the SABR model is as instantaneous as Black’s model. \\nWe discuss SABR in a section of its own below. 269 Asset Classes (I) \\n35% 30% 25% 20% 15% 10% \\n5% 0% \\n0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12% \\nFigure 17.2 The implied volatility smile of a European swaption. Deep OTM call option implied \\nvolatilities tend to ﬂatten out the deeper one goes OTM. The smile shape is different to the equity \\nskews. \\n17.1.7 Interest Rate Caps  and Floors \\nAn interest  rate  cap is an OTC derivative that makes a payment to the holder when a speciﬁed \\nshort-term interest rate rises above a speciﬁed cap rate. Interest rate cap maturities typically \\nrange from 1 year to 7 years, and the derivative makes periodic payments where, at each \\nsuch payment date, the difference between the underlying reference rate and the cap rate \\nis paid. Consider, for example, a 2-year cap in which each quarter a payment is made in \\nthe amount by which LIBOR exceeds 1.5%. The premium for the cap is usually paid up \\nfront. \\nThe interest  rate  cap is a series of interest rate caplets , one for each period up to the cap’s \\nmaturity. A caplet is simply a European call option on the reference rate with strike rate equal \\nto the cap. The payoff of a caplet on a rate L struck at K is \\nCaplet payoff (T ) = N · α · max( L(T ) − K , 0) \\nwhere N is  the notional value exchanged and α is the day count fraction corresponding to \\nthe period to which L applies. This is essentially a call option on the LIBOR rate observed at \\ntime T . \\nThe interest  rate  cap allows its holder to limit a ﬂoating rate exposure to interest rates \\nrising. By buying an interest rate cap on the rate to which the investor is exposed, he receives \\npayments when the rate exceeds the cap rate (the strike). The longer the maturity of the cap \\nthe more it offers this protection, but the more expensive it is. \\nAn interest  rate  ﬂoor is deﬁned similarly as a series of ﬂoorlets, each of which is a put option \\non a reference rate, typically LIBOR. The buyer of the interest rate ﬂoor receives payments \\non the maturity of any of the individual ﬂoorlets; the reference rate is below the speciﬁed \\nﬂoor. \\nBoth the caplets  and ﬂoorlets are valued using Black’s model, and again the relevant implied \\ncaplet volatility will be used. 270 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n17.1.8 The SABR Model  \\nThe SABR  model  was pioneered by Hagan et al. (2002). SABR stands for Stochastic Alpha, \\nBeta and Rho, as these (along with a parameter ν) are the parameters that form the model. The \\nSABR model deserves a subsection of its own; in fact it deserves a whole lot more. The key \\npoint is that although in equities, for example, there is no real market standard for managing \\nskew risk, in interest rates and FX there is: it is this SABR model. Broker quotes for swaption \\nvolatilities of different moneyness can be quoted in terms of SABR parameters. \\nSABR models  a  single forward rate, allowing for both local volatility and stochastic volatil -\\nity. As such  it allows for the modelling of swaption implied volatility smiles. The motivation \\nbehind its creation was to ﬁnd an extension of Black’s model that allowed for smiles and \\nskews but also offered correct smile dynamics. One key feature of this model is that the prices \\nof European options can be computed in closed form using the SABR formula that gives the \\ncorrect implied volatility to use in Black’s formula. This makes the model as quick as using \\nBlack’s formula, only with the added advantage that it knows about volatility smiles and also \\noffers correct smile dynamics which, in turn, gives stable hedge ratios. \\nThe SABR  formula  is based on an approximation and this can lead to troubles, these are \\ndiscussed in Appendix A, section A.3.2. Mainly, it assumes a small vol of vol, which may be \\nreasonable in interest rates or foreign exchange but not so much so in equities or commodities. \\nThe SABR formula is given by \\nα σB(K, f) = /braceleftBig /bracerightBig · \\n1 + (1−β)2 f/K + (1−β)4( fK)(1−β)/2 log4 f/K+··· 24 log2 \\n1920 \\n/parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg /braceleftbigg /bracketleftbigg /bracketrightbigg z \\nx(z) · 1 + (1−β\\n24 )2 α2 \\n( fK)1−β + 1 4 ρβνα \\n( fK)\\n(1−β)/2 + 2 −3ρ\\n24\\n 2 \\nν2 tex +··· \\nwhere \\nz= ν \\nα( fK)(1−β)/2 log f/K \\nand x(z) is deﬁned by \\n/braceleftBigg /radicalbig /bracerightBigg  \\n1 −2ρz+z2 +z−ρ x(z) =  log 1 −ρ \\nwhere\\n f is  the forward price. The ﬁrst thing to note is that although this formula appears \\ncomplicated, it is in fact closed form, and it involves nothing more than computing logarithms \\nand powers of the various parameters. This is the original form of the SABR model, and is \\nthe volatility parameter that is plugged into the Black–Scholes formula to return the prices of \\nEuropean options at the relevant strikes. Note that in the above formula the dots indicate the \\nleft-out higher-order terms that are typically ignored when the formula is implemented and \\nused. When the parameters are calibrated to an implied volatility skew across strikes, the set \\nof SABR parameters: α, β, ρ, ν gives a parameterization of this skew. \\nTo explain the  parameters we start with β. This parameter is speciﬁed within the range \\n0 ≤ β ≤ 1, and appears above mainly as an exponent of f. This is because, in the model from \\nwhich this formula came, β in fact represents the power parameter of a speciﬁc type of local \\nvolatility. When β = 0 the underlying forward is normally distributed, and when β = 1, the 271 Asset Classes (I) \\nunderlying forward is log-normally distributed. The case where β is in between represents a \\ndynamic for the forward that is neither Normal nor log-normal. \\nThe β parameter  is typically chosen ﬁrst and set to be constant, for example, if we like to \\nmodel our forward as a log-normal random variable, we set β = 1 and work with the rest of \\nthe parameters. In the case where β = 1, the model is a simple stochastic volatility extension \\nof Black’s formula in that the underlying forward is modelled as log-normal in both cases, but \\nin SABR the volatility is also modelled as a log-normal random variable compared to Black’s \\ncase where it is just a constant. \\nThe α is  a volatility-like parameter for the forward (West, 2005). Its volatility ν is thus the \\nvol-of-vol, and ρ is the (instantaneous) correlation between the underlying and its volatility. \\nα thus controls the height of the ATM implied volatility level. The correlation ρ controls the \\nslope of the implied skew and ν controls its curvature. \\n17.1.9 Exotic Inter est  Rate Structures \\nHere we discuss  some popular interest rate exotics, speciﬁcally range accruals, target redemp-\\ntion notes  and  CMS steepeners. The selection of an interest rate structure, exotic or not, can be \\nto hedge a speciﬁc set of cashﬂows, or to take a speculative view on interest rates. The exotics \\ncase can allow for a more tailored hedge or a more speciﬁc view. \\nCallable Features \\nCompared\\n to equities,  we can ﬁnd some long-dated structures, although longer structures in \\ninterest rates tend to have callable features. In a callable interest rate swap, for example, the \\npayer of the ﬁxed rate has the right to end the swap at some speciﬁed set of dates in the future \\n(possibly only one date). In exchange for this right, the investor paying the ﬁxed leg in such a \\nswap would expect to have to pay an above-market rate. \\nThese break  do wn into European and Bermudan style callable features. For a ﬁxed for \\nﬂoating swap to be European style callable, it means that the payer of the ﬁxed leg has one \\ndate in the future at which the swap may be terminated. For example in a 7-year swap callable \\nafter 2 years the payer of the ﬁxed leg has one and only one opportunity, at the 2-year mark to \\ndecide whether or not to terminate the swap. If not called at this point in time, the swap will \\nremain active till its prespeciﬁed maturity, here the 7-year point. During these ﬁrst 2 years the \\npayer of the ﬂoating leg will receive an above-market ﬁxed rate, but if rates decline then the \\npayer of the ﬁxed leg will most probably cancel the swap. \\nIn a Bermudan  style callable swap, the payer of the ﬁxed leg is given the right to call the \\nswap at a set of dates in the future. For example, a 7-year swap where the payer of the ﬁxed \\nleg can cancel the swap on an annual basis on or after the second year. Similar to the European \\ncase, if rates move against the payer of the ﬁxed leg it may be cancelled at one of these dates. \\nThe Bermudan case obviously adds more ﬂexibility, and the right to a Bermudan callable \\nfeature will cost more than a European version; however, the Bermudan feature is the more \\npopular of the two. \\nRange Accruals  \\nRange\\n accruals  are  relatively popular. Similar to the range accrual we saw in section 11.5.2, \\nthe range accrual in the interest rate case pays a coupon proportional to the number of days 272 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nthat an underlying reference rate stays within a prespeciﬁed range. A coupon as such can be \\npaid as an exotic coupon in a swap where the investor pays a ﬁxed (or even a ﬂoating amount) \\nand receives this range-dependent coupon. The range accrual coupon can also be used in a \\nﬂoating rate note. \\nThere are also  interest rate digitals where a digital call option makes a payment if a reference \\ninterest rate is above a speciﬁed barrier. Or even a digital that makes a payoff if the reference \\ninterest rate at maturity is within a speciﬁed range. \\nTarget Redemption  Notes  \\nA target redemption  note (TARN) pays a set of coupons that are linked to a reference rate, \\nwith the possibility of early redemption. The coupons are computed, typically using an inverse \\nﬂoating LIBOR rate such that once the sum of all coupons paid reaches a target amount, the \\nnote is redeemed at par. For example, consider a 7-year TARN with annual coupons in which \\nthe coupons of each year Ti are computed, based on the formula \\nCoupon( Ti ) = 2 × max [0, 4% − L(Ti )] \\nwhere L(Ti ) is the USD 12-month LIBOR at time Ti . The coupons are paid annually until \\neither the note reaches maturity or the sum of all coupons paid has reached the target amount \\nof 14%. In both cases the notional is returned as the note is redeemed at par. The appeal of \\nsuch a note is the possibility that the investor may get his money back at par plus the target \\ncoupon in what could be a relatively short amount of time. \\nCMS Steepener Options  \\nA\\n CMS  steepener  option, also known as a CMS spread option, pays a coupon based on a \\nmultiple of the spread between two CMS rates. The most popular of these is the option on the \\n30-year to 10-year CMS rate spread. The 10-year to 2-year and 30-year to 2-year structures \\nare also popular. The maturity of an option on such a spread does not have to be nearly as \\nlong; for example, one can have a 1-year option on the 10-year to 2-year CMS rate spread. \\nIf the yield curve was to steepen, the spread between these two CMS rates would increase. \\nA product as such can be appealing in an environment where the yield curve is ﬂat or even \\ninverted, and a CMS steepener option as described provides a leveraged play on the view that \\nthe yield curve will steepen. \\n17.2 COMMODITIES \\nMoving to our next asset class, here we discuss commodities. The idea is to understand \\ncommodities as an asset class of their own. Commodities can be broken down into categories: \\n• Energy, which  includes  crude oil \\n• Precious metals,  which includes gold \\n• Industrial metals, which include  copper  \\n• Agricultural products,  which  include wheat \\nThere is additionally the category of Livestock and Meat. \\nThese can be split into two categories: hard commodities and soft commodities. Hard \\ncommodities are those whose supply is limited to the ﬁnite availability of natural resources; 273 Asset Classes (I) \\nthese include metals such as gold and energy commodities such as crude oil. Soft commodities \\ninclude agricultural products and livestock that are affected by other factors such as the weather. \\nIn this section  we want to understand the properties of commodities, in particular those with \\nsigniﬁcance to commodity derivatives. This entails understanding the forward curves and the \\nvolatilities of each. For more details we refer the reader to the comprehensive books by Geman \\n(2005) and Schoﬁeld (2007). \\nThe rise in  commodity investing, which has been made even easier through commodity \\nderivatives, comes from the broad range of possible commodities that are accessible through \\nﬁnancial markets, in addition to the general belief that commodities markets are not strongly \\ncorrelated to equity markets. Commodities are also an interesting asset class as they are \\nbelieved to serve as an inﬂationary hedge. Commodities were in fact involved in some of the \\nﬁrst derivatives where farmers tried to secure certain prices for their crops that were yet to be \\nproduced. Although such derivatives were originally designed for risk management purposes, \\ntoday investing in commodities is done by many people with no such risks. \\nThe Chicago  Board  of Trade (CBOT), the ﬁrst established exchange, offers standardized \\ncommodity contracts. The CBOT along with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) are two \\nof the largest exchanges in the world offering commodity contracts. In addition to trading in \\nstandardized commodity contracts, there are many ETFs that provide exposure to commodity \\nprices directly, for example ETFs that track the spot price of gold. As such an investor can take \\na view on the price of gold without having to take hold of the physical commodity himself. \\nCommodity indices such as the GSCI and the DJAIG can also be accessed through ETFs. \\nIn addition  to  the expansion in commodity derivatives, both vanilla and exotic, there has \\nbeen a rise in the appearance of commodities as an asset class in multi-asset derivatives: \\nhybrids. An investor can add commodities to such a derivative in combination with other asset \\nclasses for diversiﬁcational beneﬁts, as a hedge for a multi-asset class exposure that involves \\ncommodities and to even take a combined view on commodities along with another asset class. \\nAlthough commodities  are  generally believed to be negatively correlated to equities, in an \\nenvironment such as that of the credit crunch of 2008, it is possible that owing to supply and \\ndemand and the global impact of the credit crunch, commodities such as oil also fall as equities \\ndo. The point of this chapter is to explain this asset class and then explain in the subsequent \\nchapter how to structure and price hybrid derivatives involving commodities, not to discuss \\ninvestment ideas in commodities. \\n17.2.1 Forward and Futur es Curves, Contango and Backwardation \\nThe forw ard curv e is the plot of forward prices with maturity T versus this maturity, and \\nsimilarly for a futures curve. A futures contract is basically a standardized forward contract, \\nwhile futures are traded on an exchange, forwards are done OTC. The word nearby refers to \\nhow close the forward contract is to expiry. The ﬁrst nearby is the closest to expiry, the second \\nnearby is the second closest to expiry, and so on. As the ﬁrst nearby expires, the second nearby \\ncontract becomes the ﬁrst nearby, and so on. \\nAn upward-sloping curv e, which means that the price for the future delivery of a commodity \\n(or asset in general) is higher than its current spot price, is referred to as contango. This means \\nthat the amount the market charges for the delivery of an asset in the future is more than what \\nwould be charged to receive delivery of the asset today. Backwardation is the opposite case \\nwhere the forward curve is downward sloping, i.e. the price of future delivery of the commodity \\nis lower than its current spot price. It is also possible to see humped forward curves. 274 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n$1,000 \\n$800 $600 $400 $200 \\n$0 \\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 \\nFigure 17.3 A typical futures curve for gold. Notice the curve is in contango, and also that the long \\nend of the curve is more stable than the short end. Although the curve is bumpy at ﬁrst, we still say it is \\nin contango as the ﬁrst few nearbys are cheaper than the longer term futures. \\nThe short end of a commodities forward curve is affected directly by supply and demand in \\nthe short term, and thus this end of the forward curve often looks less stable than the longer end \\nof the curve, which is generally smoother. When the short end of the curve is higher than the \\nlong end – that is, we are in backwardation – it generally means that the commodity in question \\nis in short supply (compared to demand). When in contango and the short end of the forward \\ncurve is lower than the long end, it means that the commodity is generally in good supply. \\nA hump at an intermediate point along the forward curve reﬂects the market’s expectation of \\na high demand at that point in time, and multiple humps can represent a seasonal change in \\ndemand (for example, natural gas in the winter). \\nAs an e xample, assume the spot price of gold is $800 per ounce. If the futures price for the \\ndelivery of gold in 3 months is $780, where payment is made on delivery, then this implies \\nthat gold is currently in short supply. The lower futures price means that the market believes \\nthat delivering gold today will be more costly than delivering it in 3 months’ time, thus the \\nbackwardation. Someone who believes that in 3 months the delivery of gold will cost more \\nthan $780 can enter into the futures contract for the delivery of gold at $780 in 3 months’ time, \\nthus taking a view on the forward curve. \\nIf the 3-month  futures price for gold were $850, it reﬂects a healthy supply of gold today, \\nwith the view that the delivery of gold in 3 months’ time is worth more than the spot price. \\nAgain a view can be taken that this futures curve will not be realized by taking the opposite side \\nof a forward contract. In fact, the use of gold as an example is not the best as backwardation \\nrarely occurs in the forward curve of gold. Figure 17.3 gives an example of a typical futures \\ncurve for gold. \\nFigure 17.4 gi ves an example of a futures curve for crude oil. There are several different \\ntypes of crude oil: West Texas Intermediate (WTI), for example, is a type of crude oil often \\nused as a benchmark for oil prices. WTI futures are traded on the New York Mercantile \\nExchange (NYMEX) where one can obtain a futures curve up to 6 years in maturity. 275 Asset Classes (I) \\n$50 $40 $30 $20 $10 \\n$0 \\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 \\nFigure 17.4 An example of a futures curve for crude oil. Notice that the curve is in contango in the \\nstart then goes into backwardation as the long-term futures are worth less than the near-term futures \\ncontracts. \\nTo understand the case of backwardation we explain the existence of a convenience yield \\nin commodities. This yield is nothing more than an adjustment to the cost of carry, which is \\nthe cost of taking on a ﬁnancial position. In the case of equities there is no cost of storage \\nbut interest rates and dividends both appear in the computation of the non-arbitrage price of \\nthe forward contracts on a stock. Buying a forward contract on a stock would involve interest \\npayments to pay for borrowed funds when buying on margin. Dividends have an opposite \\neffect as the opportunity cost of the decision to buy a forward instead of the stock itself. \\nThe inclusion of rates and dividends reﬂects this in the price of forwards in the equity case. \\nIn the case of commodities, a convenience yield should be included as an adjustment to the \\ncost of carry to account for the fact that the physical commodity itself cannot be shorted \\nand that its delivery today might be a necessity for which a market participant is willing \\nto pay a premium. The convenience yield is deﬁned as the premium that a consumer is \\nwilling to pay to be able to attain the commodity now rather than at some time in the future \\n(Schoﬁeld, 2007). \\nThe forward price,  which also serves as an approximation of the futures price, including the \\ncost of carry, is \\nF (T )  = S(0)e(r+s−c)T \\nwhere F is the forward price, T is time to delivery, S is the spot price, r is the risk-free \\ninterest rate, s represents the cost of storage, and c is the convenience yield. The value of \\nsuch a convenience yield is affected by the demand for a commodity. The case where there \\nis a shortage of a commodity with respect to the demand for it will be reﬂected in a high \\nconvenience yield. In the case where there is an abundance of supply for a commodity, this \\nyield shrinks to zero. \\nThe convenience yield  helps to explain the reason behind backwardation. In the case of oil, \\nand generally for the energy market, delivery might be a necessity, and penalties high for not 276 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n$10 \\n$8 $6 $4 $2 $0 \\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \\nFigure 17.5 An example of a futures curve for natural gas.

Obtaining oil today will carry a higher convenience yield, reﬂecting the premium \\non the price for the delivery of the spot today. \\nOne can ask  the questions: Is it possible to arbitrage the futures curve in the commodities \\nmarket? Is it possible for the oil futures curve to remain in backwardation? The answers \\nare: commodities have a non-arbitrageable forward. When the curve is in backwardation, the \\nshorter dated contracts are worth more than the longer dated ones, making the latter seem cheap \\nor incorrectly priced. To take advantage one would need to buy the longer dated contracts and \\nshort the front end of the curve. Firstly, the spot market can be quite illiquid and the asset \\nhard to obtain and thus quite difﬁcult to short. If one were to sell a contract at the front end \\nof the curve and buy the long end, then the commodity itself would need to be obtained and \\ndelivered in order to honour the obligation of the ﬁrst contract. If the commodity is not readily \\navailable in the spot market, then this forward curve is non-arbitrageable and can remain \\nin backwardation for this reason. In the case where one does take physical delivery of the \\ncommodity, storage and other costs will be incurred. As such, and since the market for these \\ncontracts is driven by participants’ fair value of future delivery, a given slope of the curve will \\naccount for these factors and not allow for an arbitrage. \\n17.2.2 Commodity Vanillas  and Skew \\nSince commodity  futures  and forwards are more liquid than the asset’s spots, these forwards \\nand futures are used as the underlyings in commodity derivatives. From a hedging perspective, \\nthe illiquidity of commodity spots and the resulting lack of shorting ability, make hedging \\nwith spots not feasible. \\nA call option  on a commodity, for example, will give the holder the right but not the \\nobligation at the maturity of the option to buy a commodity future at the agreed strike price. 277 Asset Classes (I) \\nThe underlying future will also be of an agreed maturity. In a manner similar to how we \\npreviously speciﬁed strike prices as a percentage of the current spot, the strike of an option on \\na commodity future can be speciﬁed as a percentage of the price of the underlying future at \\nthe time of pricing. \\nPricing an option  on a spot price of a seasonal commodity can also add complexity. For \\nexample, one would expect the spot price for natural gas to be higher in winter. A seasonal \\neffect must be priced into the derivative and a Black–Scholes log-normal assumption for the \\nspot price is unreasonable. However, since the seasonality effect is already priced into the \\nforward curve, it makes sense to price derivatives on points of this curve compared to using \\nthe spot price. Figure 17.5 provides an example of a futures curve for natural gas. \\nIn Black  (1976)  he modelled forward price instead of the spot price, which solved the \\naforementioned issue. We have already seen Black’s model in section 17.1.6 in interest rates, \\nhis paper was written to address this issue. Black’s model is also the standard in commodity \\nmarkets for pricing European options on physical commodities, forwards and futures. \\nCommodities will also  exhibit some form of skew in the implied volatilities of European \\noptions. This is the volatility that, when used in Black’s model, gives the correct price of the \\nEuropean option, and again implied volatility is the market’s consensus of future volatility. \\nThe commodity volatility surface consists of the implied volatilities of options on futures, for \\nwhich we have one option maturity for each futures contract maturity. The option’s maturity \\nis typically only a few days after the date the futures contract is set to expire. \\nThis term structure  is downward sloping most of the time. V olatility in commodity markets \\nis closely linked to issues of supply and demand. If the supply of a commodity is struggling to \\nkeep up with demand, volatility will rise. In the short term, supply and demand ﬂuctuations have \\na large impact on volatility causing it to be very high in cases where there is a supply shortage, \\nwhereas the longer dated implied volatilities are governed more by long-term expectations \\nregarding the economy and are generally lower. Long-term factors, such as the mining of \\nlimited resources and even the weather, can play a role depending on the commodity. \\nWith respect  to  moneyness, the implied volatilities surface will have decreasing liquidity \\nin European options struck away from the ATM point. Commodity implied volatilities also \\nimply that commodity returns are positively skewed compared to equities in which returns \\nare negatively skewed. For example, in oil, greater uncertainty is generally associated with \\nhigher oil prices. Market participants, particularly in industries, who rely on having oil in order \\nto conduct business, will need to hedge the upside risk of price increases to which they are \\nadverse. Those producing oil will want downside protection in order to protect proﬁts in the \\nevent that oil prices may decline; however, upside hedging sees more demand and comes with \\nhigher implied volatilities. 18 \\nAsset Classes (II) \\nNo complaint, however , is more common than that of a scarcity of money. \\nAdam Smith  \\nContinuing the discussion of asset classes, in this chapter we discuss foreign exchange (FX), \\ninﬂation and credit, each as a separate asset class. \\n18.1 FOREIGN EXCHANGE \\nThe foreign exchange market, often referred to as FX, encompasses everything to do with \\ncurrency trading. Again, we focus in this section on understanding the underlying market, FX \\nforward curves, FX vanillas, FX implied volatility smiles and some FX exotics. For a more \\ndetailed account of FX derivatives we refer the reader to Wystup (2007). \\nThe FX mark et is highly liquid with many quite different parties acting as market partic-\\nipants, from  corporations,  to speculators and even governments. To deﬁne an exchange rate, \\none must specify two currencies: a domestic and a foreign. These are not related to geography \\nbut simply deﬁne a standard by which values will be measured. An exchange rate is deﬁned \\nas the amount of the domestic currency required to buy one unit of the foreign currency. A \\ntransaction in FX will involve the exchange of an amount of one currency for an amount in \\nanother currency; for example, exchanging euros for US dollars. \\nTo be clear  on notation, we use the convention of foreign–domestic where, for example, the \\nexchange rate between the euro and the US dollar is written as EUR–USD and represents the \\namount of US dollars needed to buy one euro. The USD–EUR exchange rate is the inverse of \\nthis where the domestic currency is taken to be the euro. If the EUR–USD is 1.4356 then the \\nUSD–EUR is the inverse of this, given by 1/1.4356 = 0.69657. \\n18.1.1 Forward and Futur es Curves \\nFutures are standardized  forward contracts that are traded through an exchange, and these are \\nthe more popular choice among currency speculators; many futures positions are closed out \\nbefore they reach expiry. An FX future is a contract that allows the holder to buy or sell a \\ncurrency for a speciﬁc price at a speciﬁc date in the future. Forward contracts in FX are traded \\nOTC and are the more popular choice for parties hedging FX exposures. FX forward contracts \\ndo not need to be settled with the delivery of the foreign currency, and can be cash settled in \\nthe domestic currency. If the investor actually wanted to take hold of an amount of foreign \\ncurrency, then the contract can be speciﬁed so that it is settled in the foreign currency. \\nThe FX forw ard rate is affected by the interest rates in both the domestic and foreign \\ncurrencies. In fact the most important factor in determining an FX forward rate is the spread \\nbetween the two interest rates. If we recall the concept of the cost of carry – that is, the cost \\nof taking on a ﬁnancial position, including the opportunity costs – in the case of FX we can \\nexpect the buyer of an FX forward to be long interest rates in the domestic currency and short 280 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nJPY 100 \\nJPY 80 JPY 60 JPY 40 JPY 20 \\nJPY 0 \\n0 5 10 15 \\nFigure 18.1 A USD–JPY forward FX curve. Notice that the curve is in backwardation, reﬂecting the \\ncase where interest rates in Japan are relatively lower. \\ninterest rates in the foreign currency. The FX forward, which delivers an amount of a currency \\nat time T is given by the formula \\nF(T )  = S e(rd −rf)T (18.1) \\nwhere S is  the FX spot price, rf is the risk-free rate on the foreign currency, and rd is the \\nrisk-free rate in the domestic currency. This formula is explained by understanding the effect \\nof interest rates and what is known as interest rate parity. \\nDifferent countries  usually  have different interest rates, and this means that money in one \\ncurrency can grow at the local risk-free rate, which is different to how it would grow at the \\nrisk-free rate in another currency. This must be reﬂected in the price of an FX forward or there \\nwould be an arbitrage opportunity, and interest rate parity relates FX forward prices to interest \\nrates in the form of a non-arbitrage condition. Assume that an investor borrows money in one \\ncurrency and converts it to another currency in which the risk-free rate on interest is made on \\nthis amount. An FX forward, that would be used to lock in an exchange rate at a future date to \\nconvert this money back to the original currency, must be priced so that the risk-free returns \\nfrom such a trade match those in the original currency. \\nFormula (18.1)  describes  this parity in the case where we assume continuous compounding \\non interest. When both interest rates are equal, the forward price must equal the spot price. \\nWhen rates are different, and depending on which is higher, the forward curve can be in \\ncontango or backwardation. Different interest rate term structure shapes can also impact the \\nshape of the forward curve and it is not necessarily smooth. Figure 18.1 shows a USD–JPY \\nforward curve in backwardation. The bigger the difference between the two rates, the steeper \\nthe slope of the forward curve. \\nCarry Trades A carry  trade\\n  is a play on the interest rate differentials between two currencies that involves the \\nFX rate. Assume that a forward curve is quite steep, reﬂecting a large interest rate differential, \\nthen an investor can enter into a carry trade that involves selling the currency with the lower 20 281 Asset Classes (II)  \\ninterest rate and buying the currency with the higher interest rate. The play on the FX rate is \\nthat the investor is paying the lower risk-free rate on the money borrowed, and receiving the \\nhigher interest rate yield in the second currency, thus netting a proﬁt. \\nThis is not  an arbitrage strategy as it will only be proﬁtable if the currency does not move \\nagainst the investor. If the currency does not move then at the end of the investment period the \\ninvestor can change money back to the original currency and pay off the loan in that currency, \\nhaving netted the proﬁt from the difference in interest rates. If the currency with the higher \\nrate were to depreciate relative to the currency in which the investor is borrowing, then when \\nthe time comes to exchange the money back to cover the original loan, the value in the original \\ncurrency will be lower and it is possible to make a loss. \\nThe opposite  can  also happen where the investor makes additional gains if the currency \\nwith the higher yield appreciates. One can put on a carry trade and continuously net the \\ninterest rate differential, and close out the trade once the FX rate moves in the wrong direction; \\nhowever, exchange rates can jump suddenly in the wrong direction leaving the investor with \\nan immediate loss. Since the forward price is governed by interest rate parity, it is not possible \\nto hedge this FX risk completely and a view must be taken on the exchange rate between the \\ntwo currencies. \\nA typical  currenc y to borrow in is the Japanese Yen because interest rates in Japan have been \\nvery low. An investor can borrow money in JPY paying very little interest and exchange yens \\nfor another currency with a high interest rate that can be in excess of 10% per annum. Carry \\ntrades can also involve borrowing in a low-yielding currency and investing in a high-yielding \\nasset other than a bond, but again the same risk remains, in addition to the risks the asset in \\nquestion also adds that its yield will not be paid. \\n18.1.2 FX Vanillas and V olatility Smiles \\nFX options  are  mostly OTC and are highly liquid – particularly those written on a forward \\nrate. Exchange-listed FX options exist, and although these greatly reduce counterparty credit \\nrisk, the OTC market is much bigger. An FX option is a derivative in which the holder has a \\nright but not the obligation to exchange money from one currency to another at a ﬁxed strike \\nrate and speciﬁed maturity date, both speciﬁed in the terms of the option. \\nIf we tak e a call option in USD on one unit of a stock for a ﬁxed strike price, then this strike \\nprice is the amount of dollars that will be paid for one unit of the stock if the option is exercised \\nat maturity. An FX option involves the exchange of two notionals in different currencies, and \\nthe strike is given by the ratio of these notionals. As FX can be confusing, we will clarify by \\nuse of an example. \\nAssume that an  investor buys 1,000,000 options with a GBP–EUR strike at 1.3464, where \\nthese options give the holder the right but not the obligation, at maturity, to sell GBP 1,000,000 \\nand buy EUR 1,346,400 (1.3464 × 1,000,000). The GBP notional of the trade is GBP \\n1,000,000, and the EUR notional of the trade is EUR 1,346,400 so that the ratio of the \\ntwo is equal to the strike price. If the investor decided on a different strike for the option, then \\none of these notionals must change in order that the new strike is still the ratio of the two \\nnotionals. To set the option ATM, the strike would have to equal the current spot exchange \\nrate between the two currencies, and if one notional is ﬁxed then the second notional will have \\nto be set so that the ratio of the two matches the spot. \\nIn the abo ve option, if the EUR appreciates w.r.t. the GBP, then the GBP–EUR exchange \\nrate has decreased (the amount of EUR needed to buy one GBP has gone down). The holder 282 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nof the above option has the right to sell GBP 1,000,000 and receive EUR 1,346,400 at a time \\nwhen the EUR has appreciated, which means that GBP 1,000,000 is currently worth less than \\nEUR 1,346,400. Such an option is thus a put option on GBP, and it is the market convention \\nto quote an exchange rate strike using the terminology of a GBP–EUR strike in reference to \\nthe put option that increases in moneyness as EUR gains w.r.t. the GBP. It also acts like a call \\noption on the EUR. The opposite option can be speciﬁed where the put is on the EUR (call on \\nGBP) and the strike, assuming the same notionals, will be the inverse of the previous strike, \\ni.e. 1/1.3464 = 0.7427, and this would be referred to as a EUR–GBP strike. \\nThe premium  char ged for entering into an FX option depends on how many contracts are \\nbeing bought. This premium can be computed using the Garman and Kohlhagen (1983) model, \\nwhich is essentially an extension of the Black–Scholes model that accounts for the two interest \\nrates. As such, the model, like Black–Scholes, assumes that the exchange rate is log-normally \\ndistributed. The idea is to use this model to obtain the value of one contract and the premium \\ncan thus be computed by multiplying the cost of one contract by the number of contracts. \\nFollowing the same  notation as before, let rd denote the risk-free rate in the domestic \\ncurrency, and rf that of the foreign currency. The domestic currency refers to that in which the \\noption will be denominated. Caution must be taken when specifying the spot and strike. As \\nthe strike and spot of a call option on a stock will be speciﬁed in terms of dollars per stock, \\nthe strike and spot in the FX case must also be speciﬁed in terms of the same units. \\nIn the abo ve example involving GBP and EUR, the call option will be denominated in GBP \\nand the EUR–GBP strike price will be used for a call option. The strike and the spot must be \\nspeciﬁed in the same units: here we are using the number of domestic currency units per unit \\nof foreign currency. It is the domestic currency that is exchanged for the foreign currency at \\nmaturity if the option is exercised. If we denote the spot and strike by S and K , then the values \\nof calls and puts under the Garman and Kohlhagen model are given by \\nFX Call Option price = S e−rf T N (d1) − K e−rd T N (d2) \\nThe value of  a put option has value \\nFX Put Option price = K e−rd T N (−d 2) − S e−rf T N (−d 1) \\nwhere \\nln(S/K )\\n + (rd − rf + σ 2/2)T d1 = \\nσ √ \\nT  \\nand \\n√ \\nd2 = d1 − σ T \\nand the parameter  σ, which should be used, is the implied volatility. Much like the previous \\ncases we have seen, the market for vanilla options is driven by the premiums at which market \\nmakers are willing to trade, and the observed implied volatilities represent the consensus of all \\nviews. The implied distribution for FX will not be log-normal, but using the correct implied \\nvolatility obtained from the market in the above formula will yield the market price of the \\noption. \\nThe implied  v olatilities in the case of FX typically exhibit smiles, not skews. This means \\nthat ATM options will have lower implied volatilities than both ITM and OTM call options. \\nThis is the market’s way of pricing a premium on FX options struck away from the money \\nto include the risk that an exchange rate can have extreme moves in either direction.

The smile is (almost) \\nsymmetric. \\nexistence of the smile means that the market believes such are more probable than a log-\\nnormal distrib ution  implies. An extreme move in an exchange rate between two currencies \\nis the result of a depreciation of one currency w.r.t. the other, and the smile in FX markets \\nprices this uncertainty in both directions (Figure 18.2). The implied volatility smile is not \\nnecessarily symmetric, and a steeper skew on one side can reﬂect more uncertainty in one of \\nthe currencies. \\nFX vanilla options  must satisfy a put–call parity relationship. This is the equilibrium rela-\\ntionship that must  exist between the prices of put and call options on the same underlying and \\nwith the same strike and expiry. \\n−rf T − K e−rd TC (K , T ) − P(K , T ) = S e\\nfrom this the parity of  the  Deltas of the call and put is \\n/Delta1call − /Delta1put = e−rf T \\nwhich for small maturities, and low foreign interest rates, we have /Delta1call − /Delta1put ≈ 1. \\nRisk Reversals The risk re\\nversal is an option strategy that involves a call and a put. A long risk reversal consists \\nof a long OTM call option and a short position in an OTM put option, both with the same \\nmaturity but different strikes. The strikes are speciﬁed in terms of the Deltas of the two options \\n(Figure 18.3). In a typical risk reversal, the Deltas of both the call and put are chosen to be 0.25. \\nAs such it would be referred to as a 25-Delta risk reversal, and the market quotes the 25-Delta \\nrisk reversal as it gives information regarding expectations on the currencies composing the \\nunderlying exchange rate through the skewness of the implied volatility surface. \\nThe risk re versal expresses the difference in the implied volatilities of the OTM call and \\nthe OTM put. By showing a higher implied volatility for either the call or the put, and thus \\nimplying a higher price for such an option, this tells us the direction in which the market expects \\nthe underlying to move. If the volatility of put options is higher, it means that the implied 284 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n10% \\n5% 0% \\n1.12 1.16 1.2 1.24 1.28 1.32 1.36 1.4 1.44 \\n–5% \\n–10% –15% \\n25-Delta OTM Call 25-Delta OTM Put 25-Delta Risk Reversal \\nFigure 18.3 The payout of a risk reversal. It combines calls and puts in what is usually referred to as \\na collar. \\ndistribution of returns is skewed in its expectation of a possible large downward movement \\nand small but more frequent upward movements, much as for the case of the equity skew. This \\ncase is referred to as a negative risk reversal. In a positive risk reversal the opposite holds and \\nthe market places higher volatilities on call options, suggesting that the distribution is skewed \\nin the opposite manner, and reﬂects expectations of large possible upward movements but with \\nlow frequency, compared to smaller downward movements of higher frequency – the opposite \\nof the equity case. Risk reversals on a currency pair can change sign over time, and thus the \\nFX market is said to have a stochastic (i.e. random) skew. \\nRisk reversals are  typically quoted by giving the Delta of the call and put, a volatility \\nspread that gives the bid–ask spread on the derivative, and an indication of which is higher \\nbetween the volatilities of the calls and puts (i.e. which is favoured). Though the 25-Delta \\nrisk reversal is somewhat of a standard, one can obtain a quote for a risk reversal with any \\nDelta, for example a 10-Delta corresponding to the risk reversal formed from Europeans with \\na Delta of 10%. For example, a 1-month 25-Delta risk reversal on USD–EUR can be quoted \\nat 0.2/0.3 with EUR calls favoured over EUR puts, Here, 0.2 and 0.3 correspond to spreads \\nover some mid-volatility, typically the ATM volatility, and these give the bid–ask spreads for \\nthe risk reversal in question. Assuming this mid-level to be 10%, then this quote means that \\nthe trader is willing to do two things: ﬁrstly, to buy the 25-Delta USD put (EUR call) for \\n10% + 0.2% = 10.2% and sell the 25-Delta USD call (EUR put) for 10%, and, secondly, to \\nsell the 25-Delta USD put (EUR call) for 10% + 0.3% = 10.3% and buy the 25-Delta USD \\ncall (EUR put) for 10%. The favouring of the EUR call over the EUR put means that the trader \\nis bid–asking the EUR call price at 10.2–10.3%, and leaving the EUR put volatility at the mid \\nlevel of 10%. \\nStraddles, Strangles  and Butterﬂy Spreads \\nStraddles and strangles  are also option strategies that are constructed using European options, \\nand these were discussed in Chapter 6. Both of these, like the risk reversal, are quite popular 285 Asset Classes (II)  \\nin FX and there is a liquid market for them in many currencies. In fact, these are also standard \\nin the sense that it is quotes from these, like the risk reversal, that are used to give information \\nregarding the market’s view on the underlying currencies through their implied volatilities. \\nAgain the strikes of the European options composing these products are speciﬁed in terms of \\ntheir Deltas. \\nA straddle  position  consists of two long positions, one in a call and one in a put. If we recall, \\na straddle can be constructed at a strike that is speciﬁed so that the Delta of the straddle is \\nzero at initiation. In the case of FX, the ATM straddle refers to the straddle that is struck at a \\nstrike for which the Delta of the position is zero. As in the case of equities, this strike will be \\nat or very close to the forward price, and it is this zero Delta feature that made the straddle a \\ntraditional method for trading volatility in equity derivatives. A European option comprising \\na straddle must, of course, have the same maturity. \\nGoing long a  strangle, one is again long two call options but with different strikes. A 25-\\nDelta strangle  is  composed of a long position in a 25-Delta call option and a long position in \\na 25-Delta put option. The strangle, combined with knowledge of the ATM straddle implied \\nvolatility, gives us a measure of convexity. The reason is that these two combine to give a \\nbutterﬂy spread. \\nButterﬂy spreads,  often  referred to as Flys in FX, are another options strategy, and also one \\nthat we have seen in section 4.2.1 of Chapter 4 under the discussion of convexity of implied \\nvolatility skews, and section 6.3.1 of Chapter 6 under option strategies. A risk reversal contains \\ntwo options and it gives us information regarding which way the market is skewed, whereas the \\nbutterﬂy spread involves three European option strikes and gives us a measure of the convexity \\nof the smile. In FX, the butterﬂy spread will involve European options struck ATM and at the \\ntwo strikes corresponding to a speciﬁc Delta for each European option on either side. \\nButterﬂys that are  constructed from straddles and strangles take an inverted shape to \\nthose we saw before. Figure 18.4 shows the payoff of a short position in a butterﬂy \\n15% 10% \\n5% 0% \\n–5% \\n–10% –15% \\n25-Delta Strangle 25-Delta Butterfly 1.12 1.16 1.2 1.24 1.28 1.36 1.4 1.44 1.32 \\nATM Straddle \\nFigure 18.4 The payout of a short position in a butterﬂy spread. This is formed using an ATM straddle \\nand a 25-Delta strangle. 286 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nspread as the combination of a long position in an ATM straddle and a short position in a \\nstrangle. \\nThe method  for  quoting a butterﬂy spread, other than the maturity and Delta speciﬁcation \\nof the away-from-the-money options involved in its construction, is again a volatility spread. \\nFor example, a 1-month 25-Delta strangle quoted at 0.2/0.38 implies that the trader is willing \\nto buy 25-Delta strangles at a volatility spread of 0.2% over the implied volatility of the \\nATM (zero Delta) straddle. It also means that she is willing to sell the 25-Delta strangle for \\na volatility of 0.38% over the same ATM straddle. The ATM straddle’s implied volatility will \\ngovern whether the trader would rather buy or sell the strangle. If it is closer to the 0.2% then \\nshe favours buying the strangle over selling it; if closer to the 0.38%, then selling the strangle \\nis favoured, and if it is right in the middle of this spread, i.e. 0.29%, then the trader is equally \\nwilling to buy or sell the strangle. Garman–Kohlhagen, SABR  and\\n  Smiles \\nWhen quoting  Deltas  for any of the options above, these always refer to the Black–Scholes \\nDeltas that are computed using the implied volatilities of the quotes. To be correct, it is the \\nGarman and Kohlhagen formula that is used. This allows for a standard method of computing \\nthe strikes of the above options and agreeing on Deltas. It is key to have a standard method to \\ncompute the Delta if this is to be exchanged as part of the transaction. So the 25-Delta call with \\nan implied volatility of 10% is the call option whose strike is such that when this strike and \\nimplied volatility are used in the Garman and Kohlhagen formula, and the Delta is computed, \\nit will be equal to 0.25. \\nTo capture  the  smile, one has to venture beyond the Black–Scholes framework. A local \\nvolatility can be used, although the SABR model discussed in section 17.1.8 is a market stan-\\ndard in FX.  Since most vanilla contracts in FX are written on forward rates, the SABR model, \\nwhich models a forward rate, lends itself perfectly to the pricing and risk management of a port-\\nfolio of FX  vanillas. Further details on the SABR model appear in section A.3.2 in, Appendix A. \\nThe parameters  of  the SABR model have direct links to the discussed options. The volatility \\nparameter, α, will control the level of the smile, and this volatility level is known through \\nthe market’s quotes for ATM straddles. The correlation ρ between the underlying and the \\nvolatility controls the skew, ∂σ (K )/∂ K , which in the FX market we know through quotes \\nof risk reversals. The vol-of vol parameter ν controls the smile’s curvature, ∂2σ (K )/∂ K 2, \\nfor which we also have the market values of strangles. Calibrating a SABR model to these \\npoints will give us the set of parameters that capture the market information of level, skew and \\ncurvature of the implied volatility smile. The β parameter can be used in the calibration, and \\nas the local volatility parameter of the model it controls the deterministic skew; however, it \\nis usually speciﬁed in advance based on ap r i o r i , and held constant. For example, the case of \\nβ = 1 refers to log-normal dynamics for the underlying and all other parameters are calibrated \\nwith this β ﬁxed. \\nWhat makes this  model signiﬁcant is not only the intuitiveness of its parameters and their \\ninterpretations, but the dynamics generated by this model are consistent with what is observed \\nin the market regarding how the skew moves as the underlying moves, ∂σATM /∂ S. As such, the \\nmodel yields much more realistic hedge ratios. The beneﬁts that were clear in the interest rate \\ncase also hold here in that this model is essentially a closed form extension to Black–Scholes, \\nis lightning fast, and serves as an excellent tool for risk managing a portfolio of European \\noptions in FX. /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg 287 Asset Classes (II)  \\n18.1.3 FX Implied Correlations  \\nThe nature  of  exchange rates means that in certain cases one can compute the implied cor-\\nrelation between  tw o exchange rates. Consider two exchange rates with the same domestic \\ncurrency, for example the EUR–USD and the JPY–USD, then we know the EUR–JPY ex-\\nchange rate as  the quotient of these two. Call the two exchange rates of common domestic \\ncurrency R1 and R2, and their quotient R3 = R1/R2. Assume that we have implied volatilities \\nfor each of these three exchange rates, obtained from vanilla options on each, then applying \\nthe Black–Scholes assumption of log-normality of these rates, we know that the quotient of \\ntwo log-normals is also log-normal. \\nR1ln = ln R1 − ln R2R2 \\nboth of ln R1 and ln R2 are normally distributed (recall a log-normal random variable is one \\nwhose logarithm is normally distributed), and their difference thus also normally distributed. \\nOn the one hand, we know the implied volatility of R3 from the market, but we also know it must \\nbe a function of the volatilities of R1 and R2 according to the above equation. Working with \\nvariances, we know Var(ln R3) = σ 2(R3) on the one hand, but also from the FX relationship \\nabove that \\nVar(ln R3) = Var(ln R1/R2) \\n= Var(ln R1) + Var(ln R2) − 2Cov(ln R1, ln R2) \\n= σ 2(R1) + σ 2(R2) − 2 ρ1,2 σ (R1)σ (R2) \\nSubstituting the market value of Var( R3) into this equation and solving for ρ1,2 we ﬁnd that \\nσ 2(R1) + σ 2(R2) − σ 2(R3)ρ1,2 = 2 σ (R1)σ (R2) \\nwhere the right-hand  side of this equation is all implied from the vanilla markets of each of \\nthe three exchange rates. \\nWystup (2002)  gi ves a geometric interpretation of this and describes how the same concept \\ncan be extended to multiple currencies. The key observation is that because of the nature of \\nthe FX market and in light of the above formulas, FX correlation risk can be transformed into \\na volatility risk, and hedging this correlation risk is thus possible by using adjusted Vegas. \\nThis can be extremely useful when handling baskets of currencies. \\n18.1.4 FX Exotics \\nFX exotics, lik e the other asset classes, can be used for tailoring speciﬁc market views, hedging \\nspeciﬁc FX risks, or even be structured to offer higher yields or better diversiﬁcation. Digital \\noptions and barriers are especially popular in FX, and it is possible to ﬁnd broker quotes for \\nsome barrier and digital options, making them more liquid in comparison to their counterparts \\nin different asset classes. Many different types of barrier options exist in FX and below we \\nmention a few of them. \\nAn interesting  e xample of a barrier option is the Parisian barrier. This is a knock-out option, \\nwhere the option knocks out only if the underlying spends a certain amount of time above \\n(or below, depending on the position of the barrier) the barrier. As such, this differs from the \\nsimple barrier that knocks out if the underlying crosses the barrier at any point in time. The 288 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nidea behind the Parisian barrier is that if the underlying is close to the barrier, a short spike in \\nthe underlying won’t cause the option to knock out (or knock in). For example, consider an \\nup-and-out ATM call option that has a Parisian barrier at 125%, monitored daily, and of length \\nﬁve business days. Then the call option will only knock out if the barrier spends ﬁve or more \\ndays above this 125% barrier. \\nThe Parisian barrier  option will obviously be worth more than the simple barrier and will \\nincrease in price the longer the length of time the underlying has to spend beyond the barrier. \\nA key feature of the Parisian barrier option is that its Greeks are far smoother at the barrier \\nthan the simple barrier option case, and as such alleviate some of the related issues that \\narose in Chapter 10. An interesting variation on the barrier option would be to decrease the \\nparticipation in the call option above for each day the underlying spends beyond the barrier. \\nFor example, the call option can start with 100% participation and decrease by 12.5% each \\nday the underlying spends beyond the barrier. \\nIt is of  course possible to structure a basket option where the underlying assets are all \\nexchange rates. These will typically have a common domestic currency and the speciﬁcation \\nof different foreign currencies gives the different exchange rates in the basket. The analysis \\nof baskets in Chapter 7 generally holds, and the addition of multiple assets helps to lower the \\noverall volatility of the basket, compared to the volatility of a single underlying. For example, \\nthe basket can consist of differently weighted emerging market currencies’ exchange rates \\nwith the EUR. \\nForward skew-dependent payof fs such as cliquets are also found in the FX market. The \\ncliquet style and related payoffs seen in Chapters 13 and 14 can be structured with FX rates \\nas underlyings. The issues regarding forward skew and Vega convexity will still hold, but \\ndepending on the style of cliquet, the skew effect may be different, as it will, even for regular \\ndigitals, compared to equities, because of the presence of a smile. \\nVariance and v olatility swaps are also traded in FX, and these are the same payoffs we saw \\nin Chapter 16. Again these are essentially forward contracts on the future realized variance (or \\nvolatility) of an FX rate. The general model free replication results will still hold for the payoff \\nof variance swaps on an FX, however the effect of skew may be slightly different to equities \\nbecause of the FX smile. The formulas will also change to allow for foreign interest rates \\ninstead of dividends. The methods for trading skew using corridor and conditional variance \\nswaps will also be different for this reason. V olatility derivatives in FX again serve the purpose \\nof providing pure exposure to volatility, and as such allow an investor to trade the volatility of \\nan FX rate directly. \\n18.2 INFLATION \\nThis section deals with inﬂation as an asset class. The inﬂation market may not be as liquid \\nas the previous ones, but it does have many uses, and it is a market that has witnessed \\nconsiderable growth recently and does not appear to be losing momentum. In this section we \\ndiscuss inﬂation and focus on the inﬂation products that exist from inﬂation swap and bond \\nto inﬂation derivatives, with the ultimate goal of combining other asset classes with inﬂation \\nin multi-asset class payoffs. In the literature, pricing inﬂation derivatives and related products \\nare discussed, among others, by Hughston (1998). Inﬂation products and in-depth uses and \\nmotivations are covered extensively in Deacon et al. (2004). 289 Asset Classes (II)  \\n18.2.1 Inﬂation and the  Need for Inﬂation Products \\nInﬂation is the  increase in the price of a basket of goods and services over time. The basket \\nin question is a weighted collection of goods and services that serves as a representative for \\na whole economy. Essentially, when inﬂation occurs, the general price of goods rises, which \\nmeans that the purchasing power of a speciﬁc currency is lower, meaning that the real value of \\na unit of currency is lower. Deﬂation is the opposite phenomenon referring to the case where \\nthe same basket of goods has declined in price. \\nAn inﬂation  rate  is a measurement of how inﬂation has changed over a period of time. To \\nhave an inﬂation rate there must be an inﬂation index – that is, the dynamically weighted \\nbasket as above that is modiﬁed to continuously reﬂect the general price of goods and services \\nin an economy – and these are referred to as “Consumer Price Indices” (CPIs). The percentage \\nchanges of such an index are a measurement of the inﬂation rate, and the main CPI indices of \\nspeciﬁc countries are typically computed by government agencies – for example, the UK RPI \\n(retail price index), the US CPI, and the Eurozone’s HICP. Such indices are widely monitored \\nbecause the inﬂation rate is a key consideration for many ﬁnancial decisions, including the \\ninterest rate policies of central banks. These indices are not directly tradeable, but are accessible \\nvia futures markets on such indices (for example, futures contracts on the CPI trade on the \\nChicago Mercantile Exchange). The price of these futures is informative because their prices \\nrepresent some form of market consensus regarding the index itself. Some inﬂation index \\nfutures are, however, not very long dated. \\nIn the conte xt of inﬂation, it is key to deﬁne the terms nominal interest rate and real interest \\nrate. The nominal interest rate is a rate of interest that has not been adjusted to account for \\ninﬂation. Take a government bond that pays 4% per annum, then the rate of 4% is a nominal \\nrate of interest. Assume that an investor purchases such a bond and collects the 4% on top \\nof the notional back after the ﬁrst year, then it is not necessary for the buying power of the \\namount of money he currently holds (104% of the notional amount) to have gone up by 4%. \\nIf the rate of inﬂation that same year were 1.5%, then it means the buying power of the new \\nnotional is in fact 1.5% less. The real interest rate is (approximately) the difference between \\nthe nominal interest rate and the inﬂation rate for the same period. The real interest rate is thus \\nthe inﬂation-adjusted nominal interest rate, in this case given by 4% − 1.5% = 2.5%. \\nMany investors are  concerned with the buying power of their money, and even in the case \\nof, for example, a capital guaranteed note, with redemption of at least 100%, the 100% of \\nnotional is in fact worthless in real terms if the currency has witnessed (positive) inﬂation. \\nWhen inﬂation occurs, the time value of such a notional is in fact decreasing, and many \\ninvestors want to be protected against these inﬂation risks. The need for inﬂation products thus \\narises, and the client base is quite large because many investors need to have inﬂation-linked \\nreturns. For example, a large corporation that must give annual salary increases equal to the \\ninﬂation rate, does not know in advance what the rate of inﬂation will be for the upcoming \\nyear(s), and thus needs a method of hedging this risk. Other examples would be investors \\nwho want to take a direct view on an inﬂation rate going up or down, and need a method of \\nexpressing such speculative views. \\n18.2.2 Inﬂation Swaps  \\nIn\\n a typical  inﬂation swap, two counterparties exchange cashﬂows where one party pays a \\nﬁxed (or possibly ﬂoating) rate in exchange for a ﬂoating rate that is linked to a measure of /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg 290 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\ninﬂation such as a CPI index. The inﬂation swap, like other swaps, is entered into at zero \\ncost, which means that the ﬁxed rate side of the swap reﬂects the market’s consensus on \\ninﬂationary expectations. Inﬂation swaps are typically computed on the basis of compounded \\nrates, meaning that the payer of the ﬁxed leg will pay a compounded ﬁxed rate on the swap \\ndates and receive the cumulative rate of change in the inﬂation index. For example, a 5-year \\nswap at a ﬁxed swap rate of 1.78% will pay the rate of 1.78% compounded, on the notional, in \\nexchange for the compounded change in inﬂation, thus hedging the notional from inﬂation in \\nexchange for the ﬁxed cost. This is known as a zero coupon inﬂation swap, and is a fundamental \\nbuilding block in inﬂation markets. \\nA different inﬂation  swap would be the year-on-year inﬂation swap. In this swap, the payer \\nof the ﬁxed rate at the end of each year will pay an amount equal to the notional times this \\nﬁxed rate, and receive the annual period to period return of an inﬂation index given by \\nCPI Index(n)Notional × − 1  CPI Index(n  − 1) \\nwhere n goes  from 1 up to the number of years speciﬁed in the contract of the swap. This type of \\nswap would be better suited to an investor who needs to receive annual payments linked to the \\ninﬂation rate that was realized during that year in order to meet some obligation. Additionally \\nit is useful to a speculative investor who believes that the current market consensus on the fair \\nswap rate is high and is willing to pay inﬂation and receive ﬁxed with the view that inﬂation \\nwill be lower than anticipated. \\nThe case of  deﬂation is also included in the swap, as described above, in that if inﬂation \\ndecreases over one or more years, then the return on the index will be negative and the payer of \\nthe ﬁxed leg will end up paying both legs of the swap. To avoid this, a ﬂoor can be introduced \\ninto the ﬂoating leg payments. \\n18.2.3 Inﬂation Bonds  \\nInstead\\n of of fering a nominal rate of interest that is common to most bonds, an inﬂation \\nbond’s rates are based upon real interest rates. The nominal rate appearing in bonds does not \\naccount for inﬂation and is thus generally higher than the real interest rate yields offered on \\ninﬂation-linked bonds. Inﬂation bonds are not new as many sovereign entities have issued \\ninﬂation-linked bonds for many years. These are known as inﬂation-indexed bonds, where the \\nnotional is indexed to inﬂation. In the UK, inﬂation-linked gilts are linked to the UK RPI, and \\nin the US, for example, there are Treasury inﬂation-protected securities that are linked to the \\nUS CPI. OTC inﬂation-linked bonds offered by some corporations will have a yield that is \\njust the rate of a government issued inﬂation-linked bond plus a spread corresponding to the \\ncreditworthiness of the issuer. \\n18.2.4 Inﬂation Deri v atives \\nInﬂation swaps and  bonds allow investors to gain exposure to inﬂation, or transfer inﬂation \\nrisk, but more tailored views or needs regarding inﬂation may be required. This has spurred \\nthe development of inﬂation derivatives that allow parties to transfer inﬂation risk in many \\ndifferent forms. It is possible to trade options on some CPI indices, although many of these \\nare OTC and one has to rely on broker quotes for prices. /bracketleftbigg /bracketrightbigg 291 Asset Classes (II)  \\nInﬂation caps and ﬂoors are a good way to take a leveraged view on inﬂation. Payment from \\nan inﬂation cap, like the interest rate cap, comes from a series of inﬂation caplets. The cap can \\nbe based on the year-on-year inﬂation rate, and each caplet has a payoff based on an inﬂation \\nindex I , and the payoff of the i th caplet is given by \\nI (ti ) − I (ti −1)Caplet payoff (i ) = max 0, − K I (ti −1) \\nwhere the inde x i runs over all maturity dates for the caplets. Each of these payoffs is essentially \\na call option on the inﬂation rate with strike K . The payoff will be multiplied by a notional \\namount. Other than the ﬁrst, the caplets based upon year-on-year inﬂation are forward starting. \\nIf the periods over which the caplet is taken are unequal, then the strike can be speciﬁed \\ndifferently as K × (ti − ti −1) to reﬂect this. Inﬂation ﬂoors and ﬂoorlets are the put option \\nanalogy of caps and caplets. \\nA caplet,  as  such, is related to the yields of a coupon paying a year-on-year inﬂation-linked \\nbond if these rates are ﬂoored to avoid negative coupons from deﬂation. Quotes for inﬂation \\ncaps will exhibit an inﬂation implied volatility smile where looked at across strikes, and this \\nwill need to be captured by a modelling assumption to price more elaborate inﬂation-linked \\nderivatives whose hedges rely on caps of different strikes. The smile can be explained as \\nnormal by the market’s supply and demand for options of different strikes. Quotes involving \\nimplied volatilities will again correspond to prices through Black’s model. \\nThe inﬂation  cap  can be based on the zero coupon inﬂation swap, and in this case the caplets \\nare just call options on the zero coupon swaps and are typically spot starting. The more popular \\noption involving the zero coupon inﬂation swap is the inﬂation swaption, that is, the analogy \\nof the interest rate swaption. In an inﬂation receiver swaption, the holder has the right to pay \\nthe ﬂoating leg of an inﬂation swap, and in the payer inﬂation swaption the right to enter into \\nan inﬂation swap and pay the ﬁxed leg. \\n18.3 CREDIT \\nCredit generally refers to borrowing power. In a transaction where one party lends money \\nto another, credit risk arises, and this is the risk that the debtor will be unable to repay the \\namount of money, the interest charged on it, or both. The borrowing power of an individual \\nor corporation is based upon how much credit risk the party lending the money will have to \\nassume in the transaction. It is the party that owed (or will be owed) money that is subject \\nto this risk and the greater the credit risk, the more the lender will want to be compen-\\nsated for lending  money. Both the ability and the willingness of the borrower to repay are \\nfactors. \\nCredit ratings  are  used to assess the creditworthiness of an entity, be it an individual, a \\ncompany or even a country. Credit rating agencies use the levels of assets and liabilities, and \\nthe entity’s ﬁnancial history when allocating a rating. Credit ratings will in turn be used by a \\nlender to assess the risk of lending money to such an entity, giving an idea about the borrower’s \\nability to meet whatever obligations there are within a ﬁnancial transaction. \\nCredit derivatives are  ﬁnancial contracts involving two counterparties that derive value by \\nremoving (at least part of) the credit risk from a ﬁnancial instrument, and allowing it to be \\ntransferred between the two parties. The ﬁnancial instrument whose credit risk underlies the \\ncredit derivative need not involve the two counterparties of the credit derivative itself. These \\nhave allowed for tailored solutions for the previously unhedgeable credit risk involved in many 292 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nfacets of business. The credit market witnessed huge growth in recent years, but certain aspects \\nof the credit market were to blame for starting the crash of 2008. \\nThe key instruments in  the credit markets are \\n• Bonds with default risk \\n• Credit default swaps  (CDS) \\n• Collateralized debt oblig ations (CDO). \\n18.3.1 Bonds and Default  Risk \\nIn a bond,  the issuer must repay the principal to the holder at maturity. The coupon offered on \\na bond will reﬂect the issuer’s creditworthiness because the holder of the bond has essentially \\nloaned the notional to the issuer, and the coupon will reﬂect the risk the holder is taking on by \\nbuying the bond. The idea behind a bond is that it offers a return but at a lower volatility to an \\nequity for example; however, bonds are not risk free: the buyer still runs the (credit) risk that \\nthe issuer of the bond will be unable to repay the notional at maturity (or perhaps not even the \\ninterest on the bond). \\nA higher  credit  risk of an issuer will generally be reﬂected in a higher yield on the bonds \\nbeing issued. Treasury bonds are considered the safest of all bonds because they carry a low \\nprobability of default. Other bonds will offer a higher yield, of which the spread over the rate \\nof government bonds will be a function of the risk involved in loaning the money to the issuer \\nalong with the length of time the money is to be loaned. The greater the maturity of the bond, \\nthe greater the risk of default on the bond and thus the higher the spread. Figure 18.5 gives an \\nexample of some yields of bonds of differently rated issuers. \\nA corporation,  for  example, may issue a bond that is not backed by collateral, but in the \\nevent that the corporation does default, a liquidation follows, and bond holders receive money \\n5.0% 4.0% 3.0% 2.0% 1.0% 0.0% \\n0 1 23456789 1 0 \\nInvestment Grade Corporate Bond, Rating AA High Yield Corporate Bond, Rating CC Treasury Bond \\nFigure 18.5 This ﬁgure depicts the yields of bonds along maturity for three differently rated bonds. 293 Asset Classes (II)  \\nbased on seniority. In some cases they may receive all their money, in others only cents on \\nthe dollar. The greater this risk, the greater the investor (holder) in the bond will expect to be \\ncompensated through higher coupons on the bond. \\nJunk bonds  are  higher yielding bonds that are rated as “below investment grade” by the \\nrelevant credit-rating agencies. For a bond to be investment grade at the time of issuance, the \\ncredit-rating agencies must rate the issuer as likely to be able to meet all related obligations. \\nJunk bonds do not fall into this category, and are judged at the time of issuance to be more \\nrisky than investment grade bonds. The higher yield on such bonds reﬂects this. \\n18.3.2 Credit Default  Swaps  \\nA credit  def ault swap (CDS) is an OTC credit derivative based upon the debt of a company, \\na sovereign entity, and possibly a credit index such as the iTraxx or the Dow Jones. The \\nbuyer of the CDS makes some form of payment to the seller (this leg is known as the \\npremium leg), in exchange for a payoff in the event the issuer of the underlying debt defaults \\n(known as the default leg). In the event of default, the holder of the CDS on debt in the \\nform of a bond, has bought the right to sell the bond, at par, to the party who sold the CDS \\nprotection. \\nThe price  of  a CDS that insures a notional amount of a speciﬁc debt, is given by the \\npercentage of this notional that the seller of the CDS will receive, on an annual basis, \\nin exchange for offering this protection. This percentage is referred to as a CDS spread. \\nThe annual payments typically continue until either the CDS contract expires, or a default \\noccurs. \\nA CDS  can  thus serve as a tool for managing credit (default) risk by protecting invested \\nnotionals from the event of a default. For example, if an investor is long a corporate bond, \\nthen a CDS can provide a hedge that offsets the losses incurred if the issuing corporation \\ndefaults on the bond. A negative basis trade is a single-name credit trading strategy in which \\nthe investor buys both a bond and the CDS on the same name. When the CDS spread is less \\nthan the spread on the bond, the investor receives a spread while being protected from default \\nrisk. \\nThe CDS  spread  on the debt of an issuing entity will generally be greater the less creditworthy \\nis the issuer. Vice versa, as an entity’s creditworthiness increases, the CDS spread on its debt \\nwill decrease. The greater the CDS spread of an entity, the greater the market perceives the \\npossibility of the entity defaulting. For example: the cost of protecting $1,000,000 of debt \\nissued by a corporation can be 25 bp per annum, which means that the buyer of a CDS on \\nthis notional of debt will have to pay the seller of the CDS $2,500 per year. If this corporation \\nwere to be downgraded by the rating agencies, then this CDS spread will increase, reﬂecting \\nthe greater risk in insuring its debt. CDSs thus allow an investor to take a speculative view \\non an entity’s creditworthiness and the probability that he will or will not default. This is also \\nmade easier because CDS contracts can be cash settled. \\nCDS Indices  \\nThe\\n popularity  of  CDSs has spurred the development of tradeable CDS indices that are \\nstandardized credit securities, compared to CDSs that are OTC derivatives. These indices \\nallow for exposure to multiple credits, and can thus be used to hedge credit risk or take \\nspeculative positions in a range of credits. The standardization of these indices is key to 294 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nenhancing their liquidity, allowing for investors to take positions for small bid–ask spreads. \\nThis makes trading a CDS index the more cost-efﬁcient method to hedge or take a view on a \\nbasket of CDSs, compared to buying all the CDSs separately. \\nThe composition  of  a CDS index is designed to offer speciﬁc exposure to underlyings from \\na sector, region or similar credit quality. Each has an index methodology, typically focused \\non the liquidity of the underlying CDSs. Based upon the triggering of a speciﬁc credit event \\non one of the names, it may be removed from the index. Futures are traded on such indices, \\nthrough an exchange, and these are cash settled on expiry. Additionally, OTC derivatives are \\ntraded on the CDS indices. Two examples of such indices are the iTraxx and the CDX. For a \\ncomprehensive discussion of credit derivatives we refer the reader to O’Kane (2008). 19 \\nStructuring Hybrid Derivatives \\nWhere there is no strife there is decay: The mixture which is not shaken decomposes. \\nHeraclitus \\nIn this chapter we combine the asset classes we have seen so far, and give examples of various \\nhybrids. A hybrid product serves as an investment vehicle with a speciﬁc payoff and risk \\nproﬁle that is based upon underlyings from various asset classes, compared to a multi-asset \\nequity derivative whose underlyings are from the same asset class. The functions of hybrid \\nderivatives are no different to the equity derivatives seen throughout the book, with assets from \\nmulti-asset classes now replacing multiple equities, and the standard breakdown of uses for \\nhybrid derivatives follows suit. Hybrids can serve various purposes including diversiﬁcation, \\nyield enhancement, serve as speculation vehicles for multi-asset class views and as hedging \\ninstruments for multi-asset class risk. It is possible to combine these asset classes in a suitable \\npayoff to serve any of these purposes. In the literature, Overhaus et al. (2007) discuss hybrid \\nderivatives with a focus on pricing models, and Hunter and Picot (2005/2006) discuss the \\nfunctionality of hybrid derivatives. \\nWe have at  our disposal the wealth of possible structures and multi-asset payoffs addressed \\nin the previous chapters, many, if not all, of which can be extended to work on multiple asset \\nclasses – with some caution and a dose of common sense. The possible range of investors is \\nthus quite broad. Hybrids can be structured for retail clients of banks seeking features such as \\ncapital protection, yield enhancement or risk reduction. Institutional investors can also obtain \\nhybrid products to express their macro-economic views in a single instrument through a multi-\\nasset class option – however speciﬁc these views. Additionally, any corporation or portfolio \\nmanager with multi-asset class exposures can use hybrid derivatives to hedge multi-asset class \\nrisk in an efﬁcient manner and through a single derivative. \\nFollowing suit with  all the multi-asset options we have seen so far, the investor might be \\ntaking a view on a set of paths for assets of various asset classes, but in different structures \\nthe investor can be long or short the forwards of the underlyings, their volatilities and the \\ncorrelations between them. In an outperformance option, the long investor is short the forward \\nof one underlying and long the other, and also short the correlation between the underlyings of \\nthe outperformance. In a basket call option, for example, the buyer of the option is long both the \\nvolatilities of the underlyings, the correlations between them and the forwards of the underlying \\nassets. A hybrid derivative can be constructed to express a view on any one or more of these. \\nWe break  the  chapter down into sections, each based upon one of the motivations behind \\nthe creation of hybrid derivatives. Multiple examples involving possible structures are given \\nin each section. \\n19.1 DIVERSIFICATION \\nIn Chapter 7 we discussed the concept of horizontal diversiﬁcation, which involves the use \\nof multiple assets of a similar type. When combining assets from different asset classes, \\nwe now refer to this form of diversiﬁcation as vertical .A horizontal diversiﬁcation can reduce /summationdisplay /summationdisplay 296 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nthe risk to one single asset, but when considering multiple stocks, for example, its effectiveness \\nis weakened when all such stocks are impacted in the same manner by economic events, and \\nadding additional stocks to a portfolio of stocks will not reduce this risk. \\nThe risk reduction  obtained from adding multiple assets to a portfolio is not only dependent \\non the individual asset volatilities, but also on the correlations between these assets. Recall the \\napproximate formula for the variance of a portfolio: \\nn n \\n2σP = wiw jσiσ jρij \\ni=1 j=1 \\nBy selecting assets from multi-asset classes one can ﬁnd assets that have relatively low \\nhistorical correlations, compared to those observed among equities. Although there is no \\nguarantee that these correlations will stay low, they do provide a more diversiﬁed portfolio \\nthan the horizontal diversiﬁcation case. In recent years, globalization and other factors have \\ncontributed to the increases in the correlations between various assets from both different and \\nidentical asset classes. However, there exist economic reasons as to why we expect certain \\nasset classes to be affected very differently by economic events, and their cycles to look quite \\ndifferent. As such, using multi-asset classes to diversify, should over time offer enhanced and \\nconsistent returns, while reducing the overall risk. \\n19.1.1 Multi-asset Class  Bask et Options \\nThe simplest  multi-asset  class option that serves this purpose is the basket option discussed \\nin section 7.3 of Chapter 7, where the option’s payoff is contingent on the performance of a \\nbasket of assets, here from multi-asset classes. The effects of volatility and correlation on the \\nbasket option hold even if the assets are from different asset classes. The more non-perfectly \\ncorrelated assets we add, the more the overall volatility of the basket is reduced and the price \\nof a basket call or put option decreases accordingly. The volatility of the returns of an asset \\nwill affect that of the basket and thus the decision to add it as an additional asset class depends \\non this volatility. The choice to add an additional asset class to such a basket to enhance this \\ndiversiﬁcation effect will also be based on its correlation with the remaining elements of the \\nbasket. The seller of a call or put option on a basket will be short both the volatilities of each \\nof the components and the correlations between them. The weights of individual assets in the \\nbasket option do not have to be equal, but their sum must be unity. \\nEven if an  investor were bullish on the US economy, buying a single option on the S&P \\nindex, or even a basket option on a number of US stocks, the risk of a market crash that would \\ndecrease all such equities still remains. This risk can only be removed by adding an additional \\nasset class, for example gold. The basket of the S&P 500 index (equities) and the USD price \\nof gold (commodities), in different weights even, will lower the volatility compared to both \\nindividual options. The correlation between gold and equities is not necessarily negative, but \\ngold, which is generally considered to be a safe haven, will offer quite different returns to \\nequities, particularly during a crash in equities. \\nA basket option  combining the two, along with some form of averaging to capture the \\npossible different market regimes and include these quite possibly different returns, would \\nbe a much more diversiﬁed bet. A simple capital protected structure combined with the call \\noption on just the S&P 500 would not cost the investor any money. However, the downside of \\npossibly not getting any return above the 100% guaranteed notional is lowered at the cost of \\na perhaps lower return, should the equity markets rally in a big way. 297 Structuring Hybrid Derivatives \\nAnother example can be to combine an equity index (EuroStoxx50), a commodity index \\n(Dow Jones AIG commodity index), and a bond index (iBoxx). These three possible un-\\nderlyings hav e very different return structures and volatilities, making them an interesting \\ncombination to have in a diversiﬁcation instrument. Allowing for some averaging will allow \\nthe basket to pick up these differences more easily. \\nThe correlations  between  equities and interest rates go through periods of different levels, \\nbut historically bonds exhibit a low correlation to equities. Bonds are typically used along \\nwith a portfolio of equities to lower the overall volatility and beneﬁt from this low correlation, \\nwhich allows for diversiﬁcation. Additionally, bonds will still provide some income, compared \\nto using just cash. Though the potential returns from bonds are lower than returns from the \\nother two asset classes, the inclusion of bonds will help to generate at least some return in the \\nevent that equities perform quite poorly. \\nThe correlation  between  equities and interest rates is affected by many things, including \\ninﬂation and the business cycle. The addition of the commodity index serves as an inﬂationary \\nhedge in the basket. Historically, commodity indices are positively correlated with inﬂation, \\nbut not strongly correlated with either bonds or equities, and as such the basket is quite well \\ndiversiﬁed. \\nAdditionally, one can  enter inﬂation directly into the payout of the basket as an additional as-\\nset to enhance  diversiﬁcation. Inﬂation has low to negative historical correlations with equities, \\nalthough inﬂation does exhibit strong correlations to commodities such as oil. Alternatively, \\nthe deal can be structured to include some form of inﬂation bond, in addition to a capital \\nguarantee feature to also protect against rising inﬂation. \\n19.1.2 Multi-asset Class Himalaya \\nThe Himalaya  structure  described in section 15.2 of Chapter 15 on mountain range options, \\nallows the investor to lock-in the performance of an asset before it is subsequently removed \\nfrom the basket. This type of payoff can be quite well suited to assets that have very different \\nreturn structures because it will allow the investor to pick up these different returns as the \\nmarket cycles change. This can be more suited to investors who are looking for a different \\nexposure and possible set of returns on the options than the simple basket. \\nAn example w ould be a 3-year Himalaya option for the investor who believes that a bear \\nmarket will persist in the short–medium term (oil to possibly outperform US equities and \\nbonds), but is bullish long term (US equities and bonds to outperform oil), and wants to obtain \\na return each year above a ﬁxed market rate. Additionally, the USD–EUR rate can be added \\n(USD to appreciate), in relevance to its historically negative correlation with oil prices, adding \\ndiversiﬁcation. The Himalaya on a basket of the four assets of US equities, US bonds, USD vs \\nEUR (USD to appreciate), and oil, works by taking the assets with the best return each year, \\nlocking in this return, and removing this asset from the basket. Payments can be made annually \\nto make this into an income product, or the returns paid at maturity as some weighted average. \\nOther mountain range options from Chapter 15 can also be structured to include multi-asset \\nclasses instead of just multiple equity underlyings. \\n19.2 YIELD ENHANCEMENT \\nThe next possible use for hybrids would be to beneﬁt from the possible low correlations \\nbetween some assets from different asset classes in order to enhance yields. The idea behind \\nyield enhancement is to form a payoff of multi-asset classes that increases the leverage to offer 298 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\na higher expected return but with increased risk. Investors seeking higher yields in light of the \\nlow interest rate environment currently observed in the global economy can turn to hybrids \\nas a possibility. The possible set of enhanced yields will obviously be a function of how \\nmuch additional risk is taken, but we differentiate between an investor seeking a higher yield \\nthrough hybrids and an investor who is taking an aggressive and speciﬁc view on multi-asset \\nclasses. \\nAgain we ha ve at our disposal many yield enhancing payoffs from the multi-asset equity \\ncases discussed in previous chapters. Other than explicit dispersion payoffs we also have the \\nentire mountain range option that could potentially be extended to include multi-asset classes. \\nThese serve a different purpose to diversiﬁcation and use multiple assets in order to increase \\nleverage as discussed in Chapters 8 and 9. Barriers and digitals on multi-asset classes can also \\nprovide enhanced yields. We also make use of callable features that can make the prices of such \\noptions more favourable to the buyer, and thus a callable feature can allow for an increased \\nparticipation for the same price as the non-callable version with a lower participation. \\n19.2.1 Rainbows \\nThe rainbo w, discussed  in Chapter 9 under dispersion options, pays a weighted average of the \\nperformances of a basket of underlying assets where the weights are speciﬁed according to \\nhow the assets performed during the life of the option. These lie between basket options and \\nbest-of and worst-of options – depending on how the weights are distributed. For example, a \\n50%, 30%, 20% rainbow that pays 50% of the best performing asset, 30% of the second best, \\nand 20% of the third lies between a best-of option (100% on the best performing) and the \\nequally weighted basket option. This will be priced higher than the basket option but offers a \\nbetter return, reﬂected in this higher premium, and still serves the purpose of diversiﬁcation. \\nTo leverage the  rainbow payout to serve yield enhancement is to make it a more leveraged \\ninstrument than the diversifying basket option. Lower weights can be placed on the best \\nperforming in order to lower the price and increase leverage. In this case the rainbow behaves \\nmore like a worst-of option, and the resulting lower price can allow for a higher participation \\nrate and lead to potentially enhanced returns in exchange for the increased risk. \\nTo have a  3-coloured rainbow option, the underlying basket will need to consist of at least \\nthree different assets. For example, a retail product providing emerging market exposure along \\nwith some asset class diversity can be constructed by adding a rainbow option to a capital \\nguaranteed note. Taking Brazil as an example of an emerging market that has performed well \\nin recent times, especially with respect to similar economies, one can have a 50%, 30%, 20% \\nrainbow option on a basket consisting of the Brazilian equity index the Bovespa, the Brazil \\nReal versus the USD (BRL to appreciate w.r.t. the USD), and a commodity such as oil (WTI \\nfutures, for example). This provides a diverse exposure, and will deﬁnitely be cheaper than \\nthe sum of single options on each of the underlyings, but will have a higher expected yield \\nthan the basket option. \\nTo use the  rainbow as a yield enhancer, for example, consider a bullish view on the global \\neconomy to recover with equities to rise, real estate to rise and oil to rise. This view can \\nbe structured into a leveraged payoff by taking a 25%, 35%, 40% rainbow on the basket of \\nthese three, for example the S&P 500, the EPRA real estate index and WTI futures. The \\n25% weighting on the best performing, compared to the 40% weight on the worst, makes this \\nrainbow behave more like a worst-of option. This rainbow will thus be cheaper than the call \\noption on the basket (assuming equal weights) and participation in it could be increased to 299 Structuring Hybrid Derivatives \\noffer higher leverage for the same cost. A more extreme leveraging would be to simply take \\n100% weight on the worst-of, making it a worst-of option. \\nThe correlations  and  volatilities in this example would be higher than the above basket, and \\nthe return structures more similar. The seller of a rainbow option, however, is not necessarily \\nshort correlation. A higher correlation adds to the overall volatility of the basket of underlying \\nassets, however it also increases the effect of dispersion; the net effect depending on the weights \\nof the rainbow. The discussion of Chapter 9 holds in regard to volatility and correlation in \\nrainbow options. The skew effect must also be looked at, especially because now the assets \\nincluded may have very differently behaving implied volatility skews – or smiles. This is \\ndiscussed in further detail when modelling multi-asset class skews in the next chapter on the \\npricing of hybrid derivatives. \\n19.2.2 In- and Out-barriers  \\nAdding\\n barriers  to  payoffs as we saw in Chapter 10 can also reduce the price and offer a \\nsimilar yield but with higher risk reﬂected in the decreased premium. A simple knock-out call \\noption is cheaper than its vanilla counterpart, reﬂected in the higher risk that the option will \\nknock out. An investor willing to take potentially enhanced yields in exchange for a view that \\nthe underlying will follow a speciﬁc path, can include barriers to decrease prices and increase \\nleverage. \\nWe refer  to  the case of an in-barrier for the barrier option in which the barrier is triggered \\nby an underlying that is included in the ﬁnal payout (for example, a call option on a basket \\nwith a knock-out clause on one of the underlyings), and the out-barrier for the case where the \\noption’s knock-out (or knock-in) clause is speciﬁed on an asset not included in the payout (for \\nexample, a knock-out call option on S&P 500 that knocks out if interest rates breach a certain \\nbarrier). Interesting examples of both can be constructed using multi-asset classes. \\nAn example of  a hybrid derivative with a knock-out in-barrier can be obtained by adding the \\nknock-out feature on the ﬁrst basket example of equities and gold. The barrier can be speciﬁed \\non the basket or on one of the individual assets; for example, a 3-year basket option that pays \\nthe weighted average performance of the basket of S&P 500 and gold, as long as the price of \\ngold does not go above 140% of its price at the onset. The addition of the barrier decreases the \\nprice of the option reﬂecting the added knock-out risk, and the participation can be increased \\nand the potential yield thus enhanced, in exchange for this additional risk. \\nA hybrid option  with an out-barrier can, for example, be an ATM call option on the \\nS&P 500, with a knock-out barrier on gold. The investor is bullish on US equities, but also \\nbelieves that even if gold increases it won’t go above 130% of its initial value during the \\nlife of the option. As long as gold never breaches this barrier on any of the observation \\nperiods for the barrier, the option is still alive. The more frequent the observation on gold, \\nthe more possible the barrier will be breached and the S&P 500 call option knocked out, \\nand the cheaper the option. Lowering the barrier closer to the 100% level has the same \\neffect. 19.2.3 Multi-asset Class Digitals \\nDigital options  can\\n  be structured to involve a digital view on multi-asset classes. For example, \\nan option that pays a ﬁxed coupon of X % if both oil and equities are above their current levels \\nin a year from now represents a bullish view on both asset classes. At maturity T the payoff 300 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nis given by \\nDouble Digital payoff = X % × 1{S&P 500( T )>S&P 500(0) }× 1{Oil( T )>Oil(0)} \\nIn this payoff the digital strike for each asset is the same; we are comparing time T prices of \\nthe assets with time 0 prices. When this is the case, the payoff is in fact a worst-of digital, \\nwhich has been discussed in Chapter 11. The strikes, however, need not be equal, and one \\ncould compare with 110% of the time 0 price for example, of one asset or both. \\nThe higher  the  correlation between these two assets, the more chance the option has of \\nending in-the-money, and the seller of the option is thus short this correlation. The seller \\nis short or long the individual volatilities depending on the position of the forwards. This \\noption will be worth less than the sum of two individual ATM digital call options, so taking \\nthe combined view will allow for enhanced leverage. The oil section of the hybrid could \\nbe based upon the price of WTI futures, of a speciﬁc maturity, increasing during the life of \\nthe hybrid. The investor would as such be taking a view on the forward curve. The same \\nanalysis of digitals involving multiple equities holds here with regard to the impact of for-\\nward price  mo vements on the digital, with attention to the possibility of different smiles and \\nskews. 19.2.4 Multi-asset Range  Accruals\\n  \\nBy bounding  one  or more of the underlyings in a range and considering a range accrual on one \\nor more of the possible asset classes, we can again enhance leverage. For example, a payoff \\ncan consist of a ﬁxed coupon, paid at maturity, multiplied by the percentage of days that each \\nof two assets spend within their individually speciﬁed range. By subjecting the coupon to \\ntwo assets, the potential coupons, being range bound, will be relatively higher. For example, \\nconsider an investor who believes that US equities will rise but not by more than 20%, and \\nthat the USD could appreciate versus the EUR but not gain more than 15% against the EUR \\nin the next year. Instead of buying options with barriers or outright digitals, the investor can \\nplay both ranges through a double range accrual that only accrues on the days when both these \\nunderlyings are within their respective ranges. The leverage will be quite high, and the offered \\ncoupon that is multiplied by the percentage of days that both are within the range, would look \\nquite appealing. Callable Dual  Rang\\n e Accrual: Oil and Equities \\nAdding a callable  feature to an option, where the option is callable by the seller, will make \\nthe price more favourable for the buyer. In the case of a callable range accrual on two assets, \\na more appealing coupon can be offered based upon the same ranges. The idea of the callable \\nfeature is the same as the autocallable option of Chapter 12 in that the investor hopes to obtain \\nan above-market ﬁxed rate coupon and the structure to be called in order to get his money \\nback early. \\nTake an in vestor who believes that a recession will persist for some time and also believes \\nthat oil and equities will stay bound within the 90–115% range for at least the next year and \\npossibly up to 18 months. A semi-annually callable dual range accrual of 18-month maturity \\nwill capture this. The investor pays LIBOR in exchange for this potentially above-market \\ncoupon, computed semi-annually and paid on maturity, or an earlier date if called. /summationdisplay 301 Structuring Hybrid Derivatives \\n19.3 MULTI-ASSET CLASS VIEWS \\nTo construct some of the hybrid derivatives seen so far, some market views on multi-asset \\nclasses were necessary. Here we describe some slightly more detailed views as examples for \\nwhich we structure hybrids offering the exact required exposure. The hybrid derivative can be \\nstructured as a cheaper alternative to expressing each asset class view separately. \\nICBC–CMS Steepener  Hybrid  \\nAs a ﬁrst  example, consider an investor who is bullish on a speciﬁc basket of stocks and also \\nbelieves that the yield curve will steepen, speciﬁcally the difference between the 30-year and \\n10-year CMS rates. A cheap structure to express the bullish view on the basket is the ICBC of \\nsection 9.2 in Chapter 9 where the returns of each stock in the basket are capped from above \\nat a ﬁxed cap, and the returns are then averaged to form the payout. Additionally, the view on \\nthe yield curve can be expressed through a CMS steepener option described in section 17.1.9. \\nCombining both of these into a best-of option allows the investor to express this view in a \\ncombined manner that is cheaper than two separate views, and in one payoff that will offer a \\nreturn even if one of these two parts ends out-of-the-money. A payoff for such an option with \\nmaturity T could look like \\n⎡ ⎤ \\n1\\n N /bracketleftbig /bracketrightbig /parenleftbig /parenrightbig ⎦ max ⎣0,  min Ret j (T ), Cap , X % × CMS 30y(T ) − CMS 10y(T ) − K N j =1 \\nwhere Ret j (T )i st h e r e t u r n o f t h e j th stock among the N stocks of the basket, Cap is the \\nprespeciﬁed cap rate and this ﬁrst part makes up the equity part of the hybrid. In the second \\ncomponent, the two rates are just the time T 30-year and 10-year CMS rates. X is to add \\nincreased gearing to the interest rate section of the hybrid, and K is the strike for the CMS \\nsteepener, which can be speciﬁed so that this part of the option also starts from zero. The zero \\nat the start of the payoff acts as a global ﬂoor. \\nThe option  contains  one parameter for each section that can be modiﬁed either (a) to reach \\na speciﬁc overall price for the hybrid, or (b) to increase the potential upside on one of the \\nparts at the cost of lowered potential upside in the other, in the case where we want the price \\nto remain the same. The cap of the ICBC serves as this parameter in the equity part, and the \\nstrike of the CMS steepener for the rates part. The gearing of the CMS can also be modiﬁed \\nfor this purpose. Even though this is a best-of option, and best-of can be expensive (compared \\nto a basket option on the same underlyings), the cap on the ICBC can greatly reduce the price \\ncontribution of the equity part (compared to a capped basket call), and the strike and gearing \\non the CMS part can reduce the interest rate part by lowering the participation or setting it \\nout-of-the-money. Equity Reverse Gear\\n ed Basket of Oil and CHF \\nAn investor belie ves that instability in the middle east in the next year will cause oil prices to \\nrise. Additionally the investor thinks that the CHF (Swiss franc) will appreciate with respect to \\nthe EUR, because the Swiss franc has historically been considered a safe haven during times \\nof uncertainty. The investor also expects that this may have a negative impact on US equity \\nmarkets, and is willing to include an equity view as part of a gearing on an option on the 302 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nCHF–EUR rate and oil. \\n/parenleftbigg /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg/parenrightbigg/bracketleftbigg /bracketrightbigg  S&P 500( T )  Ret oil(T ) + Ret FX(T )200% − min  × max 0,S&P 500(0)  , 100%  2 \\nFor the in vestor, this option provides a tailored interpretation of the suggested view. The \\nreverse gearing adds the investor’s view that equities may decline, and the participation ac-\\ncording to the  above payoff is bounded between 100% and 200%, where the higher participation \\ncorresponds to a decrease in the S&P 500. The equity gearing will enhance the leverage of this \\nview, and depending on the premium the investor is willing to spend, the basket can be made \\ninto a rainbow (whether moving towards a best-of or a worst-of) on the oil and FX rate part of \\nthe hybrid. One can set the oil and FX part of the hybrid to be written on an oil future and an \\nFX forward so that the option is more in line with the liquid vanilla options of each of these. \\nTail End of Economic Cycle: Equity – Inverse Floating Rate Hybrid \\nAn investor belie ves that we are at the tail end of an economic cycle, and wants to take the \\nview that, over the next 2 years, equities may still perform well but that equities will begin to \\nfall at some point and this will be accompanied by a decrease in interest rates. The investor \\nexpects a weakening of the economy and interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve. The \\ninvestor also believes that at this point rates could stay low for at least another year. \\nA 3-year  cliquet  style trigger option can be constructed where the S&P 500 is observed on \\na quarterly basis, and if a quarter has a negative return, the investor is then entered into an \\ninterest rate inverse ﬂoater on the USD 3-month LIBOR. The inverse ﬂoater will accrue on a \\nquarterly basis, with a coupon that is inversely related to this reference rate. At the point where \\nthe negative equity return occurs, the equity exposure is cancelled while quarterly returns are \\nlocked in in a period-to-period cliquet style. The investor continues to accrue returns from the \\ninverse ﬂoating rate till maturity. \\nThe equity  part  involves an ATM quarterly cliquet and the structure locks in positive returns, \\nup till the ﬁrst negative one, and a cap can be included to cheapen the structure if necessary. \\nThe reverse ﬂoating part of the structure can be ﬂoored at zero and have a quarterly coupon of \\nthe form \\nFloating Rate =  max [0, 5% − 2 × 3-month USD LIBOR ] \\nwhere the components  are  as described in the inverse ﬂoating rate note of section 17.1.3. The \\n5% ﬁxed rate and the gearing of 2 can be adjusted to better ﬁt both the view of the investor \\nand modify the price if needed. The ﬂoor in the payout turns this into a geared put option on \\nthe LIBOR rate, which is just a geared interest rate ﬂoor. The ﬂoor can also be adjusted to \\nincrease the leverage on the interest rate part. \\nEmerging Mark et  Currencies, Equities and Default \\nAn investor belie ves that several emerging market countries will run into serious problems \\nin the next 2 years, primarily because their currencies and equity markets have declined \\nseverely, and that a big portion of their large amount of debt accumulated recently is in \\nUSD, against which their currencies have declined. The investor is quite bearish on their \\nequity indices and currencies, and wants to take such a view. Additionally, the investor \\nbelieves that some of these countries will be unable to repay these debts and will default, /bracketleftbigg /bracketrightbigg 303 Structuring Hybrid Derivatives \\nunder which scenario the investor wants to receive an additional income for each default on \\nsovereign debt that occurs among the countries of the corresponding basket of emerging market \\nindices. \\nA downside put  on the basket or a rainbow style modiﬁcation would capture the downward \\nview on the equities and exchange rates, and a ﬁxed coupon can be speciﬁed additionally for \\neach default that occurs. The basket put or rainbow can be struck OTM to lower the cost of \\nthe structure and in turn possibly serve to enhance participation. \\nOil-Geared Equity  Outperformance  \\nThe investor is  more bullish on the Eurozone than the US in the next 4 years, and believes \\nthat the EuroStoxx50 will outperform the S&P 500 over this period and, additionally, that oil \\nprices will rise. Making use of the outperformance payoff, we can structure an outperformance \\noption of the EuroStoxx50 versus the S&P 500 and gear it by the price of oil. The payoff for \\na maturity T will look like \\nOil( T )  S&P 500( T ) Stoxx50( T )× max 0 , − Oil(0) S&P  500(0)  Stoxx50(0) \\n19.4 MULTI-ASSET CLASS RISK HEDGING \\nLast but not least we describe how hybrid derivatives can be used as a single instrument \\nto hedge risks from multi-asset classes. An investor looking to hedge a portfolio covering \\nmulti-asset classes would typically hedge each of these separately; however, depending on the \\nnature of the portfolio, it may be possible to hedge with just one hybrid option. The hybrid \\nderivative will cost less than the sum of the individual hedges and still provide the required \\nhedge for the portfolio of multi-asset classes as a whole. This is not magic: the reality is that \\nhedging each asset class separately is an over-hedge that does not account for correlations in \\nthe returns of the various assets. \\nProtective Multi-asset  Class Puts \\nConsider an in vestor who holds a portfolio of commodities and equities, and wants to protect \\nthe value of the portfolio against a decline in its value. A fall in the price of either can potentially \\nlower the value of this portfolio, and the traditional hedge would be to buy protective puts \\non each asset class component. The inclusion of put options reduces the overall portfolio \\nrisk because the puts will offer downside protection when the market moves against the long \\nportfolio. \\nThe cheaper  b ut equally effective hedge is to buy a hybrid that serves as a put to protect \\nthe entire portfolio of these two asset classes, instead of the two separate puts. As long as \\ncorrelation is less than 1, which it generally will be, the hybrid hedge will be cheaper and \\ninvolves only one transaction. The strikes of the put options in the naive hedge on each \\ncomponent are chosen according to how much risk the investor is willing to take on the \\nlong portfolio, and the amount of put options is a function of the weights of the underlying \\ncomponents of the portfolio. Likewise, the weights in the hybrid hedge reﬂect those of the \\nportfolio and the hybrid hedge on the portfolio will again be struck at the level beyond which \\nthe investor wants to hedge the downside of the entire portfolio. 304 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nFor example, assume that the investor is long a portfolio of equities and commodities, and \\nis not willing to lose more than 30% of the portfolio’s value, then he can buy a hybrid put \\noption on the weighted basket of the components of the portfolio with a strike of 70%. If the \\nvalue of the portfolio drops by more than 30% then the investor can exercise the right from \\nthe put option to sell the portfolio at 70% even if it has dropped further. The notional of the \\nhybrid put will need to match that of the portfolio for this to work, and the investor cannot \\nlose more than 30% on this portfolio. \\nInﬂation and Downside  Equity Protection \\nPayoffs can also  be constructed to protect the portfolio of an equity investor from inﬂation \\nrisks. If the equity portfolio performs well but inﬂation is high, then the effective rate of return \\nwill be less. Additionally the investor wants to protect the portfolio from downside risk, in \\nwhich scenario inﬂation is not the primary concern. A best-of option combining a call option \\non an inﬂation index and a put option on the equity portfolio will provide a hedge for whichever \\nof these two scenarios occurs. An example of a payoff would be \\nmax [0,  (K − 100%) − Portfolio Ret(T ), Inﬂation Ret(T )] \\nwhere T is  the maturity of the option and represents the duration of time over which this hedge \\napplies. The notional of the trade should match that of the portfolio, and the gearing of both \\nparts of the hybrid kept the same in order that the protection is in line with the portfolio’s \\nvalue. \\nThe ﬁrst part  involves the put feature on the equity portfolio, which only ends in-the-money \\nif the performance of the portfolio is lower than the strike. In the event where it does decline \\nbeyond this strike, the investor can sell the equity position at the strike K at maturity, and not \\nlose more than the difference 100% − K . If the equity portfolio were above the strike, and \\nideally above the ATM point, any excess returns would be unaffected by inﬂation because \\nthe put feature is out-of-the-money and the positive performance (if any) of inﬂation is paid \\nthrough the structure to hedge this risk. 20 \\nPricing Hybrid Derivatives \\nCommon sense is that which judges the things given to it by other senses. \\nLeonardo da V inci \\nIn this chapter we discuss the pricing of hybrid derivatives. We have already seen various \\nstructures in the discussion of asset classes and here we discuss the various risks and modelling \\nissues by providing modelling frameworks for each asset class. In the discussion of each asset \\nclass we came across the market standards, and Black’s formula came up more than once \\nas the standard formula for which market-implied volatilities are quoted accordingly. In this \\nchapter we venture into the models that allow for more elaborate options in the various asset \\nclasses to be priced. The focus is kept on the models and exotic products that are of direct \\nrelevance to the pricing of hybrid derivatives that involve more than one asset class, drawing \\non Chapter 19 for examples of structures. \\nAs always, when  we specify a model, we are exposed to model risk. As discussed in \\nChapter 4 in the context of volatility models, the choice of which models to use depends on the \\ndifferent risks involved in the option. If the payoff exhibits convexity to the price of one of its \\nunderlying assets’ prices, then we should take the underlying’s price to be a random process. \\nAgain, the model inputs must be correctly speciﬁed, and will be those that are relevant to the \\nhedging of the option. We point out that what we have learned regarding hedging throughout \\nthe book is applicable to hybrid derivatives. Additionally, the liquidity of the various assets \\nfrom each asset class, and the ability to trade individual options within these asset classes is \\nalso paramount to one’s ability to Delta, Vega and Gamma hedge an option. \\nA general  problem  with pricing hybrid derivatives is that correlations between the various \\nasset classes cannot be implied from liquid instruments and is very difﬁcult to hedge. Under -\\nstanding how each  of these correlations affects the price of a hybrid is important, speciﬁcally \\nthe magnitude of the correlation sensitivity of the hybrid and whether the seller of the hybrid \\nis long or short these correlations. As always, the price of the derivative must reﬂect the cost \\nof hedging it. The parameters used in the model will be chosen while bearing in mind any \\nresidual risks that cannot be hedged, and technical margins based on these risks will need to \\nbe taken. We also discuss copulas that are increasingly popular and can be necessary in hybrid \\nderivatives. Copulas allow us to formulate multi-variate distributions using separate processes \\nfor each asset class, allowing for different types of dependence to be modelled. Under copulas, \\nassets can be correlated in more meaningful ways, and the result is more meaningful hedge \\nratios. \\n20.1 ADDITIONAL ASSET CLASS  MODELS \\n20.1.1 Interest Rate Modelling  \\nThere is more  than one approach to interest rate modelling. The decision of which approach \\nwill depend on the structure and risks entailed in the product being priced. Possible choices \\nof which rate to model include the short rate, LIBOR rates and forward LIBOR rates. In the /bracketleftBig /bracketrightBig 306 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nmarket we know today’s yield curve, the prices (implied volatilities) of both swaptions and \\ninterest rate caps and ﬂoors, and these can all serve as calibration instruments. If an instrument, \\nfor example an OTM swaption, is to be used in the hedging of an exotic option, then it must \\nappear in the model’s calibration in order that the model shows risk against it and includes \\nthis in the pricing. The two modelling frameworks we discuss here are short-rate models and \\nmarket models. Short-Rate Models  \\nThe\\n price  of  a zero coupon bond B(t, T ), at time t and maturity T , is related to the instantaneous \\ninterest rate rt by \\n/integraltext T \\nt B(t, T ) = E e− rs ds (20.1) \\nThe rate rt is known as the short rate, and is the interest rate prevailing over a very small period \\nof time. One can think of the short rate as the interest rate cost of borrowing money from time \\nt to time t + dt , where dt is a small increment. A short-rate model describes the evolution of \\nthis short rate rt as a random variable. \\nThe dynamics  of  a short-rate model are given by its drift and volatility function; these \\nuniquely specify the ﬁrst and second moments of the process. In short-rate models, the drift is \\noften taken to be mean-reverting so that the process reverts to a long-term mean, reﬂecting the \\nview that interest rates are mean-reverting. The volatility function speciﬁes whether the process \\nin question is normal, log-normal or something else (for example, a square root process). \\nIn equation  (20.1)  the relationship between the short rate and bonds means that if we specify \\na process for the short rate, then the prices of all such bonds are given by the paths of this \\nshort-rate process. Bond prices are thus a function of the parameters of the model, and one step \\nin the calibration of short-rate models is to make sure that the prices of bonds generated by \\nthe model match as closely as possible those observed in the market through the yield curve. \\nTime dependence is often introduced to the drift of short-rate processes to allow for perfect \\nﬁts to the initial yield curve. \\nTime dependenc y  in the volatility structure is also necessary in a single-factor short-rate \\nmodel in order that it can also be calibrated to a set of ATM swaptions or caps, in order \\nto complete the calibration. One-factor short-rate models do suffer from the fact that with a \\nsingle driving source of randomness, forward rates are perfectly correlated in the model; a \\ncontradiction to market observations. This renders such models unsuitable for pricing interest \\nrate structures that are sensitive to the correlations between forward rates. Including additional \\nfactors by allowing the drift or the volatility to be random is necessary to calibrate such a \\nmodel to an entire swaption cube (strike and maturities). The additional factor will allow for \\na richer volatility structure and allow us to calibrate to swaptions or caps of different strikes \\nshould this be necessary. \\nDespite the f act that the short rate itself is not observable in the market, these models have the \\ndistinct advantage of being quite tractable, making them handy for risk management purposes. \\nAdditionally, these models lend themselves to tree implementations that in turn allow for the \\npricing of more exotic structures. For example, the Bermudan swaption of section 17.1 can \\nthus be priced using backward induction through a tree implementation of a short-rate model. \\nStructures that involve early exercise features like American and Bermudan style options are \\npriced as backward-looking structures. 307 Pricing Hybrid Derivatives \\nOne starts at the maturity of the option and works backwards in order to ﬁnd the optimal \\nexercise points of the option making the pricing of early exercise features possible. Trees \\nallow for this, whereas Monte Carlo implementations, that are by nature forward looking, are \\nnot best suited for pricing options with early exercise features, although adjustments can be \\nmade. \\nA commonly  used  short-rate model is the Hull–White model (see Hull and White, 1990). \\nTechnical details of this model and some extensions of it are given in Appendix A, section A.5. \\nLIBOR Mark et  Models \\nMarket models  are  a quite different class of models, and in these the variable being modelled \\nis directly observable in the market. The most successful of these is the LIBOR Market Model, \\nabbreviated to LMM and also known as BGM after (some of) its pioneers (Brace et al., 1997; \\nJamshidian, 1997). In an LMM the underlying variables modelled are a set of forward LIBOR \\nrates, all of which are observable in the market, compared to the short rate that is not. \\nAdditionally, these  forw ard LIBOR rates are the underlyings of liquidly traded interest rate \\nderivatives which means that their volatilities are also observable and can be implied from \\nsuch options. The modelling assumption of the log-normality of each of the forward rates \\nmeans that the prices of vanilla options will be given by Black’s formula, and the LMM thus \\nconsistent with the market standard for the pricing of such options (caps, ﬂoors and swaptions). \\nShort-rate models, on the other hand, do not offer such features. \\nA LIBOR  rate  L(t, T ), expiring at time t and paying at time T is the underlying in a caplet, a \\nseries of which forms the interest rate cap described in section 17.1.7. The LMM consistently \\nmodels a whole set of n forward rates Li (Ti , Ti +1), i = 1, ..., n, each corresponding to a \\ndifferent period. Black’s formula for caps is recovered from the model for each of the forward \\nrates being modelled, and the implied volatilities of the corresponding options are readily \\navailable to serve as calibration instruments. The key difference between the LMM and Black’s \\nmodel is that the LMM can consistently model an entire set of forward rates, compared to \\nBlack’s model that takes a single forward rate as the underlying. \\nThis modelling  frame work can also be applied to model forward swap rates, and the model \\nin this case recovers Black’s formula for European swaptions. The forward swap rate is again \\nobservable, and European swaptions are liquidly traded instruments, making calibration to \\ninterest rate swaptions instead of caps also possible. \\nThe LMM  lends  itself in a more natural way than short-rate models to being calibrated \\nto many traded instruments. The framework models a whole set of forward rates, each as a \\nrandom process, and needs the correlations between these forward rates to be speciﬁed. This \\nis also a key difference between the LMM and short rate speciﬁcations: The forward rates \\nin a short-rate model are perfectly correlated, whereas the LMM allows for a de-correlation \\nof such rates making it much more realistic, and applicable to exotics that are sensitive to \\nthe correlations between forward rates. The choice between using swaptions or caps in the \\ncalibration depends on the instruments with which we want the model to show risk and be \\nconsistent, in order to correctly price an exotic structure. \\nPricing using  an  LMM is done using Monte Carlo simulation and the model is thus well \\nsuited for structures that are forward looking. At any point in time the simulation includes the \\nhistory of each path up to that point, and thus its relevance to the exotic structure in question. \\nThe LMM  frame work, in its simplest form, does not capture the interest rate skew. Stochastic \\nvolatility and local volatility extensions of the LMM do exist (see, for example, Rebonato, 308 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\n2007). An interesting combination is that of the SABR model with the LMM, particularly \\nbecause the SABR model is a market standard for quoting implied volatility skews in swaptions \\nor caps. Making the LMM consistent with the SABR pricing formula will allow for a stochastic \\nvolatility extension of the model that will combine the beneﬁts of both these models. \\nInterest Rate/Equity Hybrids  \\nThe\\n interest  rate  modelling framework choice depends on the interest rate part of the hybrid \\nderivative. We use the two equity/interest rate hybrids described in section 19.3 of Chapter 19: \\nthe equity/inverse ﬂoating rate hybrid, and the ICBC–CMS steepener hybrid. In both cases \\none will need to allow for randomness in both the interest rate and the equity, but in a quite \\ndifferent manner in each case. \\nThe equity/in v erse ﬂoating rate hybrid of section 19.3 is a 3-year structure which, from \\nthe onset, is a quarterly cliquet, with a local ﬂoor ATM and a local cap. The returns from \\nthe cliquet are locked in up until the point where the underlying equity index has a negative \\nquarterly return, at which point the structure switches to accruing quarterly returns based on \\nan inverse ﬂoating rate. If we ﬂoor the inverse ﬂoating part at zero, then the interest rate part \\nis reduced to a set of interest rate ﬂoorlets. These are just geared put options on the relevant \\nLIBOR rate, in this hybrid taken to be the USD 3-month LIBOR rate. The ﬂoating interest \\nrate part for each quarter is given by \\nFloating Rate( ti ) = max [0, 5% − 2 × 3-month USD LIBOR( ti−1, ti )] \\n= 2 × max [0, 2.5% − 3-month USD LIBOR( ti −1, ti )] (20.2) \\nAdjusting this by  the day count function is the payoff of a twice geared ﬂoorlet, each quarter. \\nThis is a  hybrid structure on equity and a USD short-term interest rate, and because it \\nis a forward-looking structure, it can be priced using Monte Carlo simulation of a correctly \\ncalibrated model. On the equity side, we are dealing with a cliquet style payoff, which means \\nthat we immediately have forward skew risk (recall the discussion of Chapter 13), thus making \\nthe simulation of the equity path non-trivial. Some form of stochastic volatility will be needed \\nin this case, and the calibration made consistent with a non-interest rate related quarterly \\ncliquet. It is imperative that the forward skew risks and Vega convexities of the cliquet part of \\nthe hybrid are priced. \\nThe interest  rate  part is forward looking and involves forward LIBOR rates thus making it \\nsuited to treatment with a LIBOR market model. The interest rate ﬂoor quotes are obtained \\nfrom the market, with the correct strike corresponding to that of the ﬂoating rate payoff of \\nequation (20.2), and their implied volatilities used to calibrate the LMM. \\nThe two processes  will need to be correlated and, as in the case of the autocallable swap \\nof Chapter 12, we decide what to do about interest rate/equity correlation. The buyer of the \\nstructure is essentially playing on this correlation in that he expects declining equities to be \\naccompanied by a decline in rates. If correlation decreases between interest rates and equities \\nthen the chance of these two moving in opposite directions and against the client increases. \\nThe seller of the structure will need to price into these correlations the fact that it is difﬁcult \\nto hedge interest rate/equity through liquidly traded instruments. This correlation cannot be \\nimplied from the market for the same reasons, and historical estimates are the best starting \\npoint. Risk-related margins will need to be taken. \\nThe ICBC–CMS  steepener  hybrid described in section 19.3 is a best-of option between \\nthe ICBC component on a basket of underlying equities, and the (geared) spread between the 309 Pricing Hybrid Derivatives \\n30-year and 10-year CMS rates. The main risk in the equity part of this hybrid is volatility \\nskew, as the ICBC is quite sensitive to the equity skew. A local volatility model for the equity \\nprocesses will be sufﬁcient to capture and price this effect sufﬁciently. Equity correlations \\nmust also be dealt with as in the standard ICBC discussed in Chapter 9. \\nAs for the  CMS steepener part of the hybrid, spread options are sensitive to implied volatility \\nsmiles or skews, and this must be captured by the interest rate model. A constant maturity \\nswap spread option is an example of an option that is sensitive to the correlations between \\nthe forward rates, suggesting that a LIBOR market model is better suited. The LMM used \\nwill have to be one that knows about skew, meaning either a local volatility or stochastic \\nvolatility extension thereof. In this case it may be possible to use a two-factor short-rate model \\non the basis that it allows for a calibration to a swaption implied volatility cube (strikes and \\nmaturities), but also allows for some de-correlation in the forward rates. From a modelling \\nperspective, combining this with a local volatility process for each of the equities may be \\nsimpler. \\nThe correlation  between  the equities and the two CMS rates is speciﬁed keeping in mind \\nthe nature of the best-of payoff, discussed in Chapter 8. On the one hand we know that \\nthe seller of this option is short the correlations between the various equity underlyings, \\nbecause of the nature of the ICBC payoff, as discussed in Chapter 9. In a simple best-of option \\nthe seller is long the correlation between the two underlyings, but here, the second part of the \\noption consists of a spread payoff. The correlations between the equity underlyings and each \\nof the CMS rates thus affect the payoff in opposite ways. The seller of the hybrid option will \\nbe long the correlation between the ﬁrst CMS rate and the equities, and short the correlations \\nwith the second CMS rate of the spread. Again, margins need to be taken on these correlation \\nparameters. 20.1.2 Commodity Modelling  \\nBlack’\\ns model  greatly  simpliﬁes commodity modelling, but is not applicable to the spot price. \\nAdditional effects such as seasonality must be priced when modelling commodity spot prices. \\nThis depends on the commodity itself, but for examples such as oil, a model of the spot price \\nmust include information regarding the convenience yield described in section 17.2.1. This \\nyield varies considerably as supply and demand for the physical commodity change. Modelling \\nthe convenience yield as a constant will not capture the varying forms of the futures curve, and \\nthe resulting models will be unrealistic. Thus, models such as Gibson and Schwartz (1990) \\ninvolve two factors: one for the oil spot price, and one for the convenience yield. The short \\nend of the futures curve is somewhat de-correlated with the longer end of the curve, reﬂecting \\nshort- and long-term expectations, and multiple factors can better explain this de-correlation. \\nMean reversion similar  to the case of short-rate models can be used, and seasonality effects \\nbuilt into models to make them more realistic. Additionally, oil spot prices for example can \\nexhibit large jumps, suggesting the need for a jump model. Jump models, like stochastic \\nvolatility models, will allow for a calibration to the volatility skew observed in the vanilla \\noptions market. It is possible to combine all these features in models, but at the cost of greater \\ncomplexity. \\nA commodity  e xotic such as a digital is very sensitive to skew. A digital on the price \\nof oil is sensitive to the volatility skew implied by vanilla options. The implied returns are \\npositively skewed, which means that there is a skew beneﬁt in the digital, compared to a skew \\ncost in the equity case. The double digital of section 19.2.3 involves a digital on oil and one \\non equities. The skew of each has a different impact on the price of the hybrid because the 310 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nmarkets are different in nature, and in a product like this, it is key to capture both these skews. \\nLiquidity-based barrier shifts can be taken on each to smoothen out the Greeks near the barrier \\nto ensure that one can hedge. The nature of digital contracts, on single or multiple underlyings, \\nas discussed in Chapter 11, emphasizes the importance of liquidity in the underlying assets. \\nThe correlation  between  oil and equities is again a quantity that cannot be implied or hedged \\nefﬁciently. The historical correlation between WTI futures and the S&P 500 index may be \\nhistorically low, but it changes through time and there are points where this correlation has \\nincreased far beyond its long-term average. The seller of the structure is short the correlation \\nbetween oil and equities, and as usual a margin needs to be taken over the historical correlation. \\n20.1.3 FX Modelling \\nDuring the discussion  of FX vanillas we saw the Garman and Kohlhagen formula, which is \\nthe Black–Scholes equivalent for FX, and to quote FX vanillas in terms of their Deltas, this \\nmodel is used. To manage the presence of the FX smile, the SABR model can be used for \\na book of vanilla options. Other stochastic volatility models are also popular, for example \\nHeston’s model discussed in Appendix A (A.3.1) and Bates’s model in section A.4. In both \\nthese, it is the spot FX rate that is modelled, and the variance of the spot rate modelled as \\na random variable. Additionally Bates’s model allows for jumps in the underlying spot rate, \\nand the addition of jumps is the main difference between Bates’s and Heston’s models. Once \\ncalibrated to vanillas, each of these models gives the same prices for such options, but different \\nhedge ratios depending on the model assumptions. \\nFX mark ets e xhibit what is known as a stochastic skew, as we saw, meaning that the way \\nimplied returns from the market are skewed (positively or negatively), as observed through the \\nquotes of risk reversals, can change sign. Models such as Carr and Wu (2007) are designed to \\npick up this additional risk. A change in the skewness of the implied returns can have a large \\nimpact on the prices of barrier options and digitals. Pricing in this additional risk factor can \\nthus be important. Since European options are involved in the hedging of such instruments, it \\nis important that the model used for pricing these captures the possible changes in the skew. \\nWhen moving to  exotic FX structures, things get more complicated. Particularly in callable \\nlong-dated FX structures, the options are sensitive to movements in the interest rates of both \\ncurrencies of the FX. The longer the maturity of the structure, the greater this sensitivity. As \\nwe saw in Chapter 18, the FX forward is a function of the spot FX rate, and also the spread \\nbetween two interest rates geared by the time to maturity. The effect of the drift involving this \\ninterest rate spread has a greater effect on the long-term evolution of the FX process than, for \\nexample, allowing its volatility to be stochastic. \\nAs such,  for  long-dated callable FX structures, and all interest rate/FX hybrids, one must \\nuse a model that allows for randomness in not only the FX rate, but also the two interest \\nrates. In particular, the interest rate part of the model will need to be calibrated to at least \\ncapture each of the yield curves correctly, and a Hull–White style model for each of these \\nwould work. Interest rate volatility also impacts and the volatilities of the interest rate part \\nmust be calibrated to interest rate volatilities, for example using interest rate swaption-implied \\nvolatilities. The FX part will need to capture the information given by the vanilla surface. The \\nmodelling choices regarding the interest rate curves and their calibration, as well as the FX \\nprocess and its calibration, will have a huge impact on the hedge ratios given by the model. 311 Pricing Hybrid Derivatives \\nComposite Options \\nA composite  option  is an option on a foreign underlying with a strike in the domestic currency \\nof the investor. As the option is priced in the domestic currency, it pays in the domestic currency \\nif exercised. Consider a call option on an underlying S, then a composite call option involving \\nan exchange rate FX has the payoff \\nComposite Call payoff = max [0, S(T ) × FX( T ) − K ] \\nwhere S(T )  is denominated in the foreign currency, the FX rate converts this into the price of \\nthe underlying in the domestic currency, and the strike K is in the domestic currency. This is \\ndifferent to the quanto option described in Chapter 7 where the FX rate is ﬁxed up front. The \\nholder of the composite option is thus still exposed to currency movements, but beneﬁts from \\nhaving ﬁxed the strike in his domestic currency. \\nFor example, consider  a call option on Microsoft (denominated in USD) with a strike of \\n15.6 GBP, designed  for  a GBP investor. At maturity T the payoff of the composite option \\nis determined by the product of the USD–GBP exchange rate at time T and the price of \\nMicrosoft’s stock price at time T . If Microsoft is trading at USD 24 at maturity and the \\nexchange rate is 0.7 (that is, 0.7 GBP to buy 1 USD) then the product is 16.8 and the option \\nexpires in-the-money and pays 16.8 − 15.6 = 1.2 GBP. If the stock price were 25 USD and \\nthe exchange rate 0.6, then the product is 15 and the option expires OTM and worthless. \\nThe pricing  of  the quanto option involves using a quanto adjustment to the risk-neutral drift, \\nbut with no change in the volatility used. The composite, on the other hand, is essentially a call \\noption on a product basket of both the exchange rate and the underlying equity. If we assume \\nthat both the equity and the FX are modelled using Black–Scholes assumptions, in particular \\nlog-normality for both, then the product of the FX rate and the equity can also be modelled by \\na log-normal process. A Black–Scholes formula applies where one used the risk-free rate of \\nthe foreign currency, and a volatility given by \\n2σS 2 + σFX + 2 ρS,FX · σS · σFX \\nThis volatility we recognize as the approximate volatility for a standard basket option where \\nthe sum, instead of the product of the underlyings, is taken. In this case the volatility of the \\nproduct is exact for the product of two log-normals. The volatility of the product, which is \\nused in the composite option’s pricing, contains both volatilities because the composite option \\nhas risk to both the FX rate and the underlying equity. \\nThe risk-neutral  drift  is taken to be the domestic rate of the investor, for the simple reason \\nthat the drift of the product of two log-normals is the sum of their drifts. These are given by \\nrdomestic − rforeign for the exchange rate, and rforeign for the risk-neutral drift of the underlying \\nequity in its denominated currency (here this is the foreign currency). Adding these two, the \\nrforeign cancels out, and we are left with just rdomestic . This means that the expected growth of \\nthe product of these two is the risk-free rate of the domestic currency. \\nThis isn’t really  a hybrid product, but it does combine the two asset classes in a payoff, and \\nagain we see the appearance of a two-asset-class correlation. In general this correlation is hard \\nto imply and to hedge, unless one is able to obtain a quote for a relatively liquid stock/currency \\ncomposite pair. The seller of both the composite call option and the composite put option is \\nshort the FX volatility, the volatility of the underlying equity, and the FX/equity correlation. \\nAny more elaborate combination of FX and equities must be studied accordingly. The ability \\nto trade the underlyings to Delta hedge is as always key, i.e. the question of liquidity. To 312 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nhedge Vega or Gamma one must be able to trade options on the individual underlyings. The \\ncorrelation structure is again analysed and residual risk factors built into the price. \\n20.2 COPULAS \\nA copula is deﬁned as “something that connects or links together”. In a statistical context, the \\nword copula refers to a function that combines two or more univariate distribution functions \\nto form multi-variate distribution functions, allowing for different types of dependence to be \\nmodelled. Applying a copula method to ﬁnance, the univariate distributions in question will \\nbe those of ﬁnancial variables. \\nThe dependencies  obtained  through a copula are much more realistic when interpreting \\nthe correlated behaviour of these ﬁnancial assets, compared to using standard correlation \\ncoefﬁcients. The standard correlation, as deﬁned in Chapter 7, measures linear dependencies \\nbetween two random variables. \\nIf two v ariables are independent, then their correlation must be zero. The opposite is not \\ntrue, however: two variables with a zero correlation are not necessarily independent. Two \\nrandom variables can have a strong dependency on each other, i.e. far from being independent, \\nbut have a correlation of zero. Figure 20.1 depicts the discrete time series of two variables that \\nhave a correlation coefﬁcient of zero, but obviously some form of dependency exists between \\nthem. \\nThe importance  of  copulas in hybrid derivatives, and multi-asset derivatives in general, is \\nthat copulas provide a method of expressing joint distributions between assets, allowing for \\nthe simulation of these variables, and thus the pricing of multi-asset options. Hybrids present \\nan interesting set of applications because of the quite different dependencies that are observed \\nbetween the various asset classes. In this section we aim to explain the theory behind copulas \\nand their importance. In the literature, some interesting discussions of the theory and uses of \\ncopulas in ﬁnance are discussed in, among others, Cherubini et al. (2004), Overhaus et al. \\n(2007), Nelsen (1999), Schmidt (2007), and Trivedi and Zimmer (2007). \\n10% \\n8% 6% 4% 2% 0% \\n0 1 \\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \\nFigure 20.1 Two series with some dependency, but zero correlation. Zero correlation does not imply \\nindependence. /integraldisplay 313 Pricing Hybrid Derivatives \\nAs we have seen, the correlation between the various asset classes can rarely be implied or \\nhedged, and the speciﬁcation of this correlation has an impact on both pricing and hedging. \\nAlthough the traditional correlation does provide information regarding how different assets \\nbehave with respect to each other, it doesn’t allow us to specify different behaviours for \\ndifferent parts of the distribution. A copula does precisely this, and modelling with copulas \\ncan thus provide more meaningful hedge ratios. For example, in the cases of out-barriers, \\nthe Greeks with respect to the variable on which the payoff is written, Delta, Vega, etc., are \\nsensitive to movements in the asset on which the barrier knock-out clause is written. As such \\nthese Greeks will be affected by the method by which the two assets are correlated, and the \\nmore meaningful hedge ratios can result from using copulas. \\n20.2.1 Some Copula  Theory  \\nLet’s start with  the simplest case where we have only two random variables X and Y to consider. \\nAssume that each of these has its own probability distribution, represented by two functions \\nfX and fY ; these are our two univariate distributions. From these we know the cumulative \\ndistribution functions of each, denoted by FX (x) and FY (y)f o r X and Y respectively. By \\ndeﬁnition, FX (x) = Pr(X ≤ x), i.e. the probability that the variable X is less than or equal to \\nx, and in terms of the probability distribution function is given by \\nx \\nFX (x) = f (s)ds \\na \\nwhere a is the lower bound over which the distribution is deﬁned. An important property of \\nthe CDF is that, being a probability itself, means that it will take a value between 0 and 1. So \\nhow does one formulate a joint distribution J (x, y) = Pr(X ≤ x , Y ≤ y) out of these, where \\nJ (x , y) preserves the marginal distributions of both X and Y ? The answer is the copula. \\nFirstly, consider  a  uniform distribution deﬁned on the interval [0, 1]. This has a probability \\ndistribution function equal to the constant 1 on the interval [0, 1] and 0 everywhere else. Now, \\nregard the CDF of the random variable X above (and the same thing for Y ) as a transformation \\nof the distribution of X given by the above integral. This connects the probability distribution \\nof X with the CDF of X . If we assume X and Y to be continuous random variables, and \\ntheir CDFs both strictly increasing, then the variables U = FX (x) and V = FY (y) are both \\nuniformly distributed on the interval [0, 1]. \\nSo, starting  with  the two distributions, one for X and one for Y , we are able to transform \\nthese to uniform distributions on [0, 1]. A copula is only a joint distribution function of two \\nrandom variables, deﬁned on [0, 1] × [0, 1], such that both marginal distributions are also \\nuniformly distributed on the interval [0, 1]. The random variables on which the copula acts \\nare the two transformed random variables. The selection of a copula (out of many possible \\nfunctions satisfying the requirements of copulas) will specify the dependency between X and \\nY . Note  that the copula described is a 2-dimensional one, which we work with for simplicity, \\nalthough the general theory is extendible to more than two random variables. \\nThe concept  of  the copula was pioneered by Sklar (1959). Sklar’s theorem, in simpliﬁed \\nform, tells us that if J (x , y) is a joint distribution function of two random variables X and \\nY , and the marginal distributions computed from J (x , y)a r e g i v e nb y FX (x ) and FY (y), then \\nthere exists a copula C such that J (x, y) = C(FX (x), FY (y)). The converse also holds: given \\nany two uniform marginal distributions FX (x) and FY (y), and any copula function C, then 314 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nthe function J (x , y) = C (FX (x ), FY (y)) is a joint distribution function for X and Y , and it \\npreserves their marginal distributions. \\nThe main  point  from this is that the existence of the copula that gives the joint distribution is \\nnot dependent on the individual marginal distributions. This means that, in theory, whatever the \\ndistributions of X and Y , one can apply a copula to obtain a joint distribution. Also, any joint \\ndistribution function can be expressed as a copula. So through the copula, a joint distribution \\nis formed by two separate parts: the marginal distributions of both variables, and the choice \\nof dependency speciﬁed independently by our choice of copula. \\n20.2.2 Modelling Dependencies  in  Copulas \\nThe standard  correlation  coefﬁcient measures the strength and direction of the linear relation-\\nship between  the  random variables, but does not provide information about how the relationship \\nbetween the two variables changes as we traverse the distribution. A copula, on the other hand, \\nallows us to impose dependencies of different strengths between the random variables based \\non different sections of the distributions. \\nWe have seen  a simple example of this in equity markets. We generally see different \\nregimes of correlation: relatively low correlation during periods of relative stability, and \\nspikes in correlations during market crashes. The copula allows us to translate this into a \\nmodel by imposing a stronger dependency between two stocks of an index on this tail in the \\ntwo distributions. This is known as tail dependence, and can only be accomplished through the \\nuse of a copula. Recall that the tail of a single distribution corresponds to extreme events; and \\nthe equity market prices the higher probability of an extreme event through the skew, giving \\na distribution with a fatter tail than the log-normal one. Pricing an exotic structure on a single \\nasset would generally involve capturing this through a skew model, but moving to the two (or \\nmore) asset case where we may need to capture the dependency at the part of the distribution \\nwhere these fat tails occur. Given two (or more) such distributions, each representing one asset, \\na copula will allow us to model dependencies between extreme events in both. \\nAn important  feature  of copulas is that the dependence captured by a copula is invariant \\nunder increasing and continuous transformations of the marginal distributions. This means that \\na copula used to join two variables X and Y can also be used on their logarithms ln X and ln Y , \\nfor example. The idea is that if two variables are transformed by increasing transformations \\n(the logarithm for example), then the transformed versions give the same information as the \\noriginal variables. So specifying a dependency between X and Y , or their logarithms, is in \\nessence the same. This means that we can work with logarithms and returns should we need \\nto, instead of using prices for example when doing applications. The same concept does not \\napply to the standard coefﬁcient: the correlation between two asset prices and the two assets’ \\nreturns (or log-returns) is not necessarily the same. \\nIn order  that  a copula be useful, we must specify a parametric form for it. Recall, the copula \\nis a joint distribution function acting on [0, 1] × [0, 1] (in the case of two variables) such that \\nboth marginal distributions are uniform. As it turns out, we have at our disposal a whole range \\nof possible parametric forms that will satisfy the criteria to be a copula. The choice of which \\nparametric form depends on where we want to stress dependency, and below we give different \\ncopulas, each of which stresses a different part of the distribution. \\nWe start by  specifying a bivariate joint distribution J that has a useable parametric form. \\nFor example, the bivariate Normal distribution leads to what is known as the Gaussian copula /parenleftbig 315 Pricing Hybrid Derivatives \\ndescribed below. Our copula function C, acting on two variables u and v in [0,1], is given by \\nC(u,v)  = JX,YF−1(u),F−1(v) /parenrightbig \\n(20.3)X Y \\nLet’s elaborate on what this formula is saying. Firstly, X and Y are the two random variables for \\nwhich we are introducing dependencies using the copula. In this formula, F−1(u) represents X \\nthe inverse function of the CDF FX (x) of the random variable X .W ea s s u m e t h a t t h eC D F s \\nof the random variables we are modelling are strictly increasing and continuous, which means \\nthat they have an inverse. The CDF FX (x) maps the domain where X is distributed to [0,1], and \\nso its inverse F−1(u) maps this back, and takes as an argument a value u in [0,1]. Similarly, X \\nF−1(v) is the inverse of the CDF  of our second variable Y , again acting on [0,1].Y \\nEquation (20.3) comes from the earlier point where the joint distribution was deﬁned by \\nthe copula as J (x,y) = C(FX (x),FY (y)), combined with the use of the inverse function: \\nF−1if u = FX (x) then x = (u). Both inverse CDFs go from [0,1] to the domain of their X \\nrespective random variable, and the joint distribution JX,Y then acts on these. As such, we can \\nbuild a copula by starting with the marginal distributions of both X and Y and then imposing \\na distribution we know to link them. \\nConsider the case where we are not trying to introduce any dependency at all, i.e. we want \\nX and Y to be independent. The product copula is the only way to express this and it is simply \\nthe copula we obtain when the joint distribution of X and Y is simply the product of their \\nCDFs: JX,Y (x,y) = FX (x)FY (y). The following are just a few possible choices: \\n• The Gaussian  copula  allows for dependency, but does not show any dependency in the tails. \\n• The Gumbel  copula  should be used to emphasize lower tail dependencies (i.e. the downside \\nof the distributions), it only has lower tail dependency. \\n• The Clayton  copula  has upper tail dependency. \\nThe Gumbel  and  Clayton copulas are referred to as asymmetric because they are skewed; in \\nopposite ways, however. The Student- t copula is symmetric in both up and low tail dependency. \\nThe main difference between these, and copulas in general, is speciﬁcally the section of the \\ndistribution on which they show dependency; more so than how much dependency. As such, \\nif one decides to use copulas, the choice of the part of the distribution on which to increase \\ndependency must have a justiﬁable reason behind it as the copula will stress the dependency \\nin that part. 20.2.3 Gaussian Copula  \\nThe\\n Gaussian  copula  is quite popular in ﬁnance – even though it is a symmetric copula and \\nreturns among many ﬁnancial assets exhibit tail dependencies. It was originally applied to \\nﬁnance in the context of credit derivatives to model defaults among multiple corporations, as \\nproposed by Li (2000). Given its symmetric nature, it is perhaps not the best copula to use \\nfor modelling defaults, but does have many other applications. Following the above theory, \\nwe have two assets, each with its own distribution. The Gaussian copula uses the Normal \\ndistribution, which in the two-asset case is the bivariate Normal distribution, and the Gaussian \\ncopula is given by \\nC(u,v)  = N2 /parenleftbig \\nN −1(u),N −1(v) /parenrightbig \\n(20.4) \\nwhere N is  the cumulative Normal distribution. As such, in the Gaussian copula the Normal \\nmarginal distributions are made dependent via a bivariate Normal distribution. The correlation /parenleftbig /parenrightbig \\n/parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg 316 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nρ is the only free parameter in the bivariate distribution N2(x , y) above, and its value controls \\nthe dependency in this copula. \\nWe must  be  clear on this important point: the Gaussian copula is not modelling two asset \\nprices using a bivariate Normal distribution, it is modelling the dependence between their \\ntwo distributions using a bivariate Normal distribution. To be precise, it actually models the \\ndependence between the uniform distributions obtained from these. Assume that the two \\nrandom variables we are correlating via this copula are X and Y , with distribution functions \\nFX (x ) and FY (y) respectively. In formula (20.4), the variables u and v are these CDFs, which \\nare the transformed version of X and Y whose result is in [0,1]. We discuss the calibration \\nand simulation of this copula in order to clarify this theory. \\nCalibrating the Copula  \\nHere we discuss  the calibration of copulas, focusing on the case of the Gaussian copula. Assume \\nwe have two random variables X and Y for which we have selected a joint distribution that \\nmakes ﬁnancial sense. Our copula takes parametric form from this distribution, and along with \\nmarginals of X and Y , must be calibrated to market data. The use of a known parametric form \\nfor the joint distribution (the bivariate Normal in the case of the Gaussian copula) becomes \\nimportant at this step because it will simplify the process of ﬁtting the copula. \\nMarket data will  consist of a set of traded options on X , and a separate set of traded options \\non Y . We can ﬁt the marginals of each to represent the individual implied distributions, and \\nthen specify the parameter of the copula, or the marginals and the parameter of the copula can \\nbe ﬁtted at the same time. \\nIn the latter , for example, we can compute the density function of the copula. Using the \\nGaussian copula described here, we have \\n∂2C(u,v) c(u,v)  = ∂u ∂v  \\n∂2N2 N −1(u),N −1(v) = ∂u ∂v  \\n/Phi12(N −1(u),N −1(v)) = /Phi1(N −1(u))/Phi1(N −1(v)) \\nwhere \\n/Phi1(x) =√  1e−x2 /2 \\n2π \\nis the Normal (Gaussian)  probability  distribution function, and \\n1 /bracketleftbig 2/Phi12(x, y) = /radicalbig 1 exp − 2(1 − ρ2) x+ y2 − 2ρxy /bracketrightbig \\n2π 1 −  ρ2 \\nis the bivariate probability density function. This will be ﬁtted to the set of data using a \\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation method. \\nIf we w ant to capture the skewness and fat tails of the individual marginals, we will need \\na skew model for each marginal. In this case we can apply the SABR model, speciﬁcally \\nbecause, even though it is a stochastic volatility model, it has been solved to offer a simple \\nform for the prices of European options. Not only do we know the prices of Europeans via a /radicalbig /radicalbig \\n/bracketleftbigg /bracketrightbigg 317 Pricing Hybrid Derivatives \\nmodiﬁed function in place of the volatility, enabling us to use Black’s formula, but we also \\nhave simpliﬁed but accurate approximations of the distributions implied by the model. This is \\nalso made possible by the fact that we are not constrained in the choice of how to model our \\nmarginals, as long as the distribution function used is invertible. Thus, each of our marginals \\ncan be set to be a random process deﬁned under the SABR model. See Appendix A, section \\nA.3.2, for more details on the SABR model. \\nSimulating the Gaussian  Copula \\nIf we assume  that we know the marginal distributions of two random variables X and Y ,g i v e n \\nby FX (x) and FY (y) respectively, the following algorithm allows us to simulate the Gaussian \\ncopula that introduces the dependency to these two. \\n1. Simulate a v ector of two independent uniform random variables {u1,u2}. \\n2. Transform these  to  Normal random variables {/epsilon11,/epsilon12}. This can be done via the Box–Muller \\ntransform: \\n/epsilon11 = −2l n u1 cos(2πu2) , /epsilon1 2 = −2l n u1 sin(2πu2) \\nThese are still independent, and will be standard Normal random variables. \\n3. Correlate these  by  multiplying by the decomposed correlation matrix, giving {n1,n2}. \\n4. Map these  back  to [0,1] by applying the Normal CDF \\n{u,v}={N ( n1),N (n2)}. \\n5. Apply the in verse marginal distributions to u and v to obtain X and Y as F (−1)(u) =X andX \\nF (−1)(v) =Y .Y \\nIn the case of standardized random variables, the correlation matrix mentioned in step 3, is the \\nsame as the covariance matrix, and is given (in the case of the standard bivariate Normal) by \\n1 ρM = ρ 1 \\nThis\\n is decomposed  into M =LLT, where L is a lower triangular matrix, and LT its transpose. \\nGiven this matrix M, the matrix L we want is given by \\nL = /bracketleftbigg\\n 1 /radicalbig 0 /bracketrightbigg \\n1 −ρ2 ρ \\nThe matrix  L  is multiplied by the vector {/epsilon11,/epsilon12}of independent Normal random variables to \\ngive a vector of two normally distributed random variables with correlation ρ.U pt os t e p3 ,w e \\nare essentially just generating random variables from the bivariate Normal distribution. Step \\n4 maps these back to the interval [0,1] via the Normal CDF. Finally, the inverse distributions \\nF −1(u) and F−1(v) give us back the variables whose marginals we want to combine in the X Y \\nGaussian copula in the ﬁrst place. The procedure described allows us to simulate such variables, \\nwith their individual marginals intact and, combined via the Gaussian copula, controlled by \\nthe correlation ρ. The tractability and relative ease of this simulation process is an important \\nfactor in the popularity of the Gaussian copula. \\nThe inverse distrib utions used in step 5 can be freely speciﬁed. They are chosen to be the \\ninverses of the two distributions we want to have as our marginals. So, assuming that our choice 318 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nof the distributions of each is invertible, we can use the inverse CDF at this step in conjunction \\nwith the Gaussian copula to get the required result. The example of the SABR model can be \\nused here; in step 5 the inverse SABR distribution is used. As such the copula will allow for \\na calibration to the implied skews of the different assets, and allow this to be combined in a \\nGaussian copula. The copula models the dependency, and this method is particularly useful \\nfor hybrid payoffs that are skew sensitive. Caution must be taken because the SABR model \\nworks on a forward process, and the result of the simulation in step 5 is a forward. \\nMulti-variate Case All the theory\\n  presented for the bivariate case extends to the multi-variate case: the existence \\nof the copula in the multi-variate case, and its ability to model dependency among multi-\\nple variables. In  the Gaussian copula, for example, the same theory holds, only the multi-\\nvariate function  Nn replaces the bivariate cumulative Normal distribution N2 in order to com-\\nbine the mar ginals of n different variables instead of two. The simulation process holds, and \\nthe calibration process too. \\n20.2.4 Pricing with  Copulas \\nOther than the  possibility of simulating the copula to price various payouts on multiple \\nvariables, there are some cases where the copula itself gives us the answer directly. \\nBivariate Digitals  in Copulas \\nConsider a digital  that pays a coupon if both the price of oil and the S&P 500 index are greater \\nthan or equal to their values today in a year’s time. \\nDouble Digital payoff = X % × 1{S&P 500( T ) ≥ S&P 500(0) }× 1{Oil( T ) ≥ Oil(0)} \\nIt is important to model the dependency here correctly, and a Gaussian copula should sufﬁce. \\nReferring to the two underlyings as S1 and S2, when writing the payoff as an expectation we \\nneed to compute the discounted value of the joint probability \\nPr [{S1(T ) ≥ S1(0)} ; {S2(T ) ≥ S2(0)}] \\nMore generally ,  consider the same payoff where the digital pays only if both are above the \\nrespective strikes K1 and K2, which in this example are today’s value of each. \\nPr[{S1(T ) ≥ K1} ; {S2(T ) ≥ K2}] \\nThis is in  fact closely related to the joint distributions function of the two. Assume that we chose \\na Gaussian copula and calibrated the copula and both the underlyings to have the marginals \\nconsistent with the market of each, then this probability is given by plugging values into the \\ncalibrated copula. \\nFirstly, let P1 and P2 be the probabilities of each individually, ending in-the-money. Let \\nB(T ) be the price of the relevant risk-free asset (bond) that we know, so \\nP1 P2 = Pr (S1(T ) ≥ K1) , = Pr (S2(T ) ≥ K2)B(T )  B(T ) 319 Pricing Hybrid Derivatives \\nAs such, P1 and P2 are the prices of the individual digitals. Sklar’s theorem allows us to write \\nthe bivariate joint distribution as a copula taking the marginals as arguments (see Cherubini \\nand Luciano, 2002). Thus we can write \\nPrice (S1(T ) ≥ K1, S2(T ) ≥ K2) = Pr(S1(T ) ≥ K1, S2(T ) ≥ K2)B(T )  /parenleftbigg P1 P2 /parenrightbigg \\n= C B(T )  , B(T )  \\nThe copula  allo ws the bivariate pricing to be broken into the dependency structure, and the \\nmarginal univariate distributions. The marginals we obtain from the market as the call spread \\nproxy for each individual digital, including all relevant information regarding the skew. We \\nrefer the reader to Cherubini and Luciano (2002) for additional discussions regarding bivariate \\npricing with copulas. 21 \\nDynamic Strategies and Thematic Indices \\nThat which is static and repetitive is boring. That which is dynamic and random is confusing. In \\nbetween lies art. \\nJohn Locke \\nIn this chapter we discuss thematic products and dynamic strategies. In these two, the focus is \\non the underlying, which will be an index of constituents whose weights change through time \\naccording to a set of rules. In thematic products, an underlying is constructed on the basis of \\na theme – for example, emerging markets or green energy. The weights of the constituents \\nof this thematic index are rebalanced at certain time intervals to ensure that it still represents \\nthe theme at hand. We describe the key balance that needs to be struck between the ability to \\ncreate such an index and the ability to structure, price and hedge options with these thematic \\nindices as the underlying. \\nIn a dynamic  strategy, one starts with a set of assets, typically from different asset classes, \\nand lays out a set of rules by which the index (the weighted average of these assets) is \\nrebalanced to achieve an investment goal. The ideas behind dynamic strategies come from \\nthe theory of portfolio management where one typically balances risky and non-risky assets \\nto achieve target levels of volatility or returns. Examples of these are the cases where one \\nsets a target level for volatility and aims to maximize returns, and the example where one \\nsets a target level for the returns and aims to minimize volatility. The weights are readjusted \\nperiodically according to a set of rules and an optimization in order to achieve these goals. We \\ndevote a section to the concepts of portfolio management in which we explain the concept of \\nrisk versus reward, and using this we move to a discussion of dynamic strategies. \\nThese are grouped  together in this chapter because they both fall under the domain of exotic \\nunderlyings. For thematic indices and dynamic strategies we discuss the motivation behind \\ninvesting in such products, the construction process of these indices, how to structure ﬁnancial \\nproducts with these as the underlying, and then how to price such options. \\n21.1 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS \\nTo understand the motivation behind investing in dynamic strategies and their construction, \\nwe must familiarize ourselves with the concepts behind portfolio management. \\n21.1.1 Mean–variance Analysis  \\nMean–v\\nariance theory  is  a portfolio formation approach based on the idea that the value of \\ninvestment opportunities can be measured in terms of mean return and variance of return. Harry \\nMarkowitz (1952) developed this theory primarily assuming that expected returns, variances \\nand covariances of all asset returns are known, and are sufﬁcient to determine the most suitable \\nportfolio. It is possible to ﬁnd investment opportunities that generate enormous returns – an \\nexample being some emerging market indices – but when these returns come with high levels /summationdisplay \\n/summationdisplay \\n/summationdisplay \\n/summationdisplay \\n/summationdisplay /summationdisplay 322 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nof risk, measured by volatility, one must consider the risk to reward ratio to determine if it is \\nthe correct investment. \\nThe mean–v ariance approach  to portfolio selection is used to allow investors to choose an \\nefﬁcient portfolio, which is a portfolio offering the highest expected return for a given level \\nof risk in the portfolio. Here, we assume that all investors are risk averse; they aim to get the \\nhighest return and at the same time bear the lowest possible amount of risk. The expected \\nreturn is approximated by the mean, whereas the investor tolerance for risk is quantiﬁed by \\nthe portfolio variance of return. \\nLet’s assume  that  an investor wants to invest in a portfolio composed of n assets \\nS1, S2,..., Sn . Then the value of the portfolio is computed as follows: \\nPortfolio value = wiSi \\ni =1,..., n  \\nwhere w i is the fraction of the portfolio invested in asset i . Note that \\nwi = 1 \\ni=1,..., n \\nFor any portfolio composed of n assets, the expected return E [Rp ]i s \\nE[Rp ] = wiE [Ri ] \\ni =1,..., n \\nwhere E [Ri ] is the expected return on asset i . In practice, this quantity is estimated using the \\nmean of returns µi computed using historical data \\n1 µi = × Ret i (t )N t=1,..., N \\nand Ret i (t ) = Si (t )/Si (t − 1) − 1, where Si (t )i st h e v a l u eo fa s s e t i at time t . \\nOn the other hand, the portfolio variance of return σp 2 used to measure the risk is computed \\nas described in Chapter 7, for N assets we have \\n2 2σp = wi σ 2 + 2 wi w j σi σ j ρi, j i \\n1≤i ≤N\\n 1≤i < j ≤N \\nwhere σi is the realized volatility of asset i and ρi, j is the historical correlation between assets \\ni and j . \\n21.1.2 Minimum-variance Frontier  and Efﬁcient Portfolios \\nWhen investors quantify  their risk tolerance, they seek the portfolio delivering the highest \\nexpected return. In order to ﬁnd an efﬁcient portfolio, one must solve ﬁrst for the asset \\nweights so that the portfolio variance is the lowest for a given level of expected return. Such \\nportfolios are called minimum-variance portfolios and contain efﬁcient portfolios. Here, we \\nﬁrst consider the case of portfolios composed of two assets to clarify the method used to draw \\nthe minimum-variance frontier. We then generalize to multi-asset portfolios. 323 Dynamic Strategies  and Thematic Indices \\nTable 21.1 Estimated  annualized returns and standard \\ndeviations of two assets. \\nExpected return  Standard  deviation \\nAsset 1 18% 27% \\nAsset 2 7% 11% \\nTwo-Asset Case \\nLet’s take the  case of an individual who has decided to invest his retirement plan assets in a \\nportfolio composed of two assets, asset 1 and asset 2. Then he uses the mean–variance analysis \\nto determine the fractions of his funds to invest in each asset. Let w1 and w2 denote the weights \\nof asset 1 and asset 2 in the portfolio; note that w1 + w2 = 1. Assuming that expected returns \\nand variances can be estimated accurately using monthly historical returns during the last 10 \\nyears, he computes the average returns, the variances of returns and the correlation of returns \\nfor the two assets. Table 21.1 shows these historical statistics. \\nGiven these  results,  one can determine the range of possible expected returns for the portfolio \\nE [Rp ] as well as the associated level of risk, i.e. the variance corresponding to each possible \\nestimated return. Note that \\nE[Rp ] = w1 E[R1] + w2 E[R2] \\nwhere E[R1] and E[R2] are the expected returns of the individual assets; then \\nE [Rp ] = 18% × w1 + 7% × (1 − w1) = 7% + 11% × w1 \\nHere, we can see that the minimum portfolio return is 7% (w1 = 0; case where the funds \\nare only invested in asset 2) and the maximum portfolio return is 18% (w1 = 1; case where \\nthe funds are only invested in asset 1). So, at this stage of analysis, one speciﬁes a set of \\nweights for the portfolio assets, computes the portfolio’s expected returns, and then quantiﬁes \\nthe portfolio’s associated variances σp 2 as follows \\n2 2 2 2σp = w1 σ12 + w2 σ2 + 2w1w2ρσ1σ2 \\nwhere σ1 and σ2 are respectively the standard deviations of asset 1 and asset 2, and ρ is the \\ncorrelation between these two assets. \\nTable 21.2 sho ws a set of portfolios and the risk/return measures performed on the different \\ncombinations. Figure 21.1 illustrates the minimum-variance frontier over the period covering \\nthe last 30 years by graphing expected returns as a function of variance. This curve shows that \\nsome portfolios provide the same expected return and have different variances. Note that the \\nvariance of the minimum-variance portfolio (the one with the lowest risk) appears to be close to \\n108 (point M) and is associated with an expected return of 8.10%. This portfolio is composed \\nof 10% of asset 1 and 90% of asset 2. Therefore, an investor should not choose a portfolio with \\nless than 10% invested in asset 1 since it would exhibit less return for a higher risk. The portion \\nof the minimum-variance frontier beginning with point M and continuing above is called the \\nefﬁcient frontier; portfolios lying there offer the highest expected return for a given level of \\nrisk. In other words, the efﬁcient frontier is the section of the minimum-variance frontier with \\na positive slope. 324 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nTable 21.2 Relation  between risk and returns for different \\nportfolios composed of the two assets described in Table 21.1.

Here, we again see the importance of \\ndiversiﬁcation that is a key concept in asset allocation. Figure 21.2 shows the minimum-\\nvariance frontiers for portfolios containing asset 1 and asset 2, assuming four different values \\nof the correlation coefﬁcient. Note that in this case, expected returns are plotted against \\nstandard deviation, which doesn’t modify the general shape of the curve. \\nFigure 21.2 illustrates  a number of interesting features about diversiﬁcation. Firstly, when \\nthe correlation is equal to 1, this means that the return on one asset is a positive linear function \\nof the return on the other. This leads to the portfolio expected return being a linear function \\nof its standard deviation. For a correlation equal to +1, both assets move in the same way and \\ndiversiﬁcation has no potential beneﬁts.

Typically, however, portfolio managers \\nform optimal portfolios using a large number of assets. Here, we show how to determine the \\nminimum-variance frontier in the multi-asset case. In fact, the idea is to compute the optimal \\nweights w1,w2, ..., wn of the n individual assets composing the portfolio such that its variance \\nis minimum for a speciﬁc level of expected return. \\nFirstly, one determines  Rmin and Rmax, the minimum and maximum expected returns possible \\nwith the set of assets. One would then need to use some form of optimizer to solve the following \\nproblem for speciﬁed values of z, Rmin ≤ z ≤ Rmax, \\nMinimize : σp 2 = wi w j Cov( Ri , Rj ) \\ni =1,..., n j=1,..., n \\nSubject to : E [Rp ] = wiE [Ri ] , and wi = 1 \\ni =1,..., n i=1,..., n \\nThe resulting weights deﬁne the minimum-variance portfolio for a given level of expected \\nreturn z. Note that, in this case, assets can be sold short since there is no constraint specifying \\nthat wi should be positive. One can add this constraint if he wants to prevent short selling from \\nhis set of portfolios. \\nAdding a Risk-Free Asset \\nSo far, we  have considered only portfolios composed of risky securities, i.e. where the standard \\ndeviation is not zero. Now, we extend the analysis to the case where an investor decides to hold \\nrisk-free assets in his investment portfolio. Here, we assume that investors share identical views \\nabout risky assets’ mean returns, variances and correlations. The capital market line (CML) /radicalBig /radicalBig /radicalBig 326 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nis the term used to describe the combinations of expected returns and standard deviations \\navailable from combining the optimal portfolio and the risk-free asset. Note that the risk-free \\nasset has an expected return equal to the risk-free rate and its standard deviation is equal to \\nzero. Thus the CML must be the line from the risk-free rate that is tangential to the efﬁcient \\nfrontier of risky assets described above. Indeed, this line has the maximum slope and provides \\nthe best risk–return trade-off. In a state of equilibrium, the tangency portfolio is the market \\nportfolio in which the proportion of all risky assets reﬂects their market value weights. \\nNow let’s determine  the CML equation. If an investor is willing to combine a portion wm of \\nhis tangency portfolio (with expected return E[Rm ] and standard deviation σm ) with a risk-free \\nasset (with expected return Rf and standard deviation σ f ), then the expected return on the \\nentire portfolio E [Rp ] is equal to the weighted average of the risk-free asset and the risky \\nportfolio, and is therefore linear: \\nE[Rp ] = (1 − wm )Rf + wmE [Rm ] \\nSince the asset  is risk free, portfolio standard deviation is simply a function of the weight of \\nthe risky portfolio in the position. This relationship is linear: \\n2 2 σ 2 + 2ρ f,m w f wm σ f σm σp = w f σ 2 \\nf + wm m \\n= w 2 · 0 + w2 σ 2 + 2ρ f,m w f wm σ f · 0f m m \\n= w2 σ 2 m m \\n= wm σm \\nIf we substitute the value of wm = σp /σ m back in the equation of the overall expected return, \\nwe get \\nE[Rp ] = Rf + (E[Rm ] − Rf )/σ m σp \\nThe equation above is the capital market line equation. Its slope, (E[Rm ] − Rf )/σ m , expresses \\nthe additional return the investor demands for every 1% increase in the market portfolio \\nstandard deviation. The capital market line is illustrated by the solid line in Figure 21.3 and \\nrepresents the expected returns of only efﬁcient portfolios. \\n21.1.3 Capital Asset Pricing  Model  \\nThe Capital  Asset  Pricing Model (CAPM) was introduced in the early 1960s and has played \\na major role in the development of quantitative strategies since then. In the literature, we see \\npioneering work by Lintner (1965) among others. Under the same assumptions we mentioned \\nin this section, the CAPM is a theory-based model that describes the relationship between the \\nrisk and return on all assets and portfolios, as follows: \\nE [Ri ] = Rf + βi (E [Rm ] − Rf ) \\nwhere E [Ri ] is the expected return on asset i , E[Rm ] is the expected return on the market \\nportfolio, Rf is the risk-free rate of return. βi is the Beta of asset i and is computed as follows: \\nσi,m σi βi = σ 2 = ρi,m \\nm σm 327 Dynamic Strategies  and Thematic Indices Expected Return 20% 18% 16% 14% 12% 10% \\n8% 6% 4% 2% 0% \\n0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% Market Portfolio \\nStandard Deviation \\nFigure 21.3 Minimum-variance frontier and capital market line. Note that the solid line represents the \\nCML. \\nThe Beta of an asset measures its sensitivity to movements in the market. It approximates the \\noverall volatility of a security’s returns against the returns of a relevant benchmark. A stock \\nhas historically moved β% for every 100% move in the benchmark, based on price level. For \\ninstance, if the Beta of an American stock is equal to 1.7, this means that if the S&P 500 index \\n(this index used as the market portfolio for American stocks) performed by 20%, the stock has \\nhistorically performed by 1.7 × 20% = 34%. Note that the market portfolio itself has a Beta \\nof 1 since σm,m = σ 2. Also, the β of a risk-free asset is equal to zero since its volatility is null. m \\nThe CAPM is an equation describing the expected return of an asset as a linear function of \\nthis asset’s Beta, which represents the market risk. The term E [Rm ] − Rf in this equation is \\ncalled the market risk premium and describes the excess return on the market compared to the \\nrisk-free rate of return. The market risk premium is multiplied by the asset’s Beta. Under the \\nCAPM, an asset with a Beta of 1 is expected to earn exactly the expected return on the market \\nportfolio. If an asset has a Beta greater than 1, this means that it exhibits more risks than the \\nmarket and then earns a higher expected excess return. Conversely, Betas less than 1 indicate \\nlower market risk that makes the expected returns lower than the markets. The CAPM theory \\nhas been used primarily to value equities and states that the higher the market risk, the higher \\nthe expected return on a speciﬁc asset. \\n21.1.4 Sharpe Ratio  \\nA\\n mean–v ariance in vestor willing to put money in one strategy among a set of investment \\nportfolios can use the Markovitz decision rule to make his choice. This rule states that an \\ninvestment A is better than another one B if it exhibits a higher expected return and a lower \\nvariance of returns. In this case, A is said to mean–variance dominate B. A point to note is \\nthat when asset allocation has both a higher mean return and a higher standard deviation, the \\nMarkovitz decision rule doesn’t enable an investor to select a superior portfolio. \\nInvestors search  for  high returns, but they should also ask how much risk they will have \\nto take in exchange for these returns. This gives rise to the expressions of the risk/reward \\nrelationship. Firstly, assume that there is a risk-free rate at which an investor can both lend 328 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nand borrow, then the Sharpe ratio can be used to measure the excess return per unit of risk \\n(risk is measured by the volatility, i.e. standard deviation). The Sharpe ratio is also known as \\nthe Sharpe index and the reward-to-variability ratio. In other words, it shows how good the \\nreturns of an investment are per unit of risk taken. Sharpe (1994) revisited his 1964 work (see \\nSharpe, 1964) and the use of the Sharpe ratio (SR) to express the measurement of risk/reward \\nhas become standard: \\nE [R −  Rf ] E [R −  Rf ]SR = = /radicalbig  σ Var [ R − Rf ] \\nwhere R is  the asset return, E[R − Rf ] is the expected value of the excess of the asset return \\n(over the benchmark return), and σ is the asset return standard deviation. \\nBy using  the  Sharpe ratio, the investor who seeks to maximize returns at the lowest volatility \\ncan quantify two positions in terms of their individual Sharpe ratios in order to decide which \\nis the better investment by selecting the one with the higher Sharpe ratio. Portfolios with a \\nmaximal Sharpe ratio are referred to as locally optimal portfolios. In the case where the Sharpe \\nratio of any admissible portfolio is negative, then the money account is the only locally optimal \\nportfolio. By maximizing the Sharpe ratio, an investor targets the highest reward per unit of \\nrisk taken. \\n21.1.5 Portfolio Rebalancing  \\nPortfolio\\n rebalancing  in volves adjusting the weights of the assets in a portfolio so that it \\ncontinuously represents the investment strategy. If the investor has an investment goal in mind, \\nbased on a ﬁxed time horizon, then as this becomes closer to being realized, the portfolio will \\ntypically need to be adjusted. If the desired returns have been realized, then in this situation \\none may increase the amount of less risky assets, and lower the weights on the riskier ones. \\nHowever, if one  is not working with a ﬁxed time horizon, and is continuously trying to attain \\nthe highest returns at the lowest possible risk, then the portfolio will need to be re-weighted \\nso that it consistently reﬂects the risk/reward ratio the investor wants to sustain. The need for \\nrebalancing arises because assets change over time (speciﬁcally, their volatilities change over \\ntime) and the overall portfolio volatility, as computed above, can change resulting in a new \\nrisk/reward ratio that is not necessarily in line with the investor’s target. \\nIf we are  thinking in terms of a portfolio with a speciﬁc ratio mix of risky to non-risky \\nassets, a rise in the risky portion of the portfolio can mean that the percentage this part holds \\nis higher than the allowed proportion. For example, assume $100 is invested, $40 in bonds \\nand $60 in equities, giving a 40% to 60% ratio, and equities increase by 15%, meaning that \\nthe value of the portfolio will now be $40 (from the bond) plus $69 from the equity. The \\nportfolio is now worth $109, but equities (the risky part) now represent 69/109 = 63.3% of \\nthe portfolio. A rebalancing is needed to bring the ratio back to the 40–60 target. Although \\nthis is different to the pure Sharpe ratio adjustment to the portfolio, one may only be allowed \\nto invest up to a certain percentage in one part of the portfolio – for example, a constraint on \\nthe maximum percentage that can be put into the various possible risky assets. As such one \\nwill seek to maximize the Sharpe ratio within the weight constraints. \\nThe rebalancing  rules  of an asset allocation strategy must be clearly deﬁned. When the \\nportfolio weights are rebalanced on a ﬁxed schedule, e.g. monthly or quarterly, this is referred \\nto as a calendar rebalancing. When the rebalancing is based on an asset’s divergence from its \\nallocated target, this is a threshold rebalancing. A calendar rebalancing offers less ﬂexibility 329 Dynamic Strategies  and Thematic Indices \\nbut is transparently simple. A threshold rebalancing is more ﬂexible but can involve frequent \\nrebalancing which can be costly in terms of the transaction costs of buying and selling. If it is \\nthe volatility of the portfolio that is to be kept at a target, then volatility rebalancing is done by \\nadjusting the underlying weights by selling those assets with higher volatilities and increasing \\nthe weights on those with lower volatilities. \\n21.2 DYNAMIC STRATEGIES  \\n21.2.1 Why Dynamic Strategies?  \\nWhen high le vels of volatility characterize a market environment, spreading across the as-\\nset classes  (equity , ﬁxed income, commodities, FX) investors wanting to stay involved ﬁnd \\nthemselves taking on a lot of risk. As a result it becomes quite difﬁcult for them to invest \\nlarge risk premiums in an unstable environment as such. Taking the case of the recent crisis \\nas an example, it was impossible for investors to get returns only by taking a Beta exposure \\nto different asset classes. Also, despite the fact that buying options for speculative purposes \\ncan provide investors with the desired leverage, most traded options have a positive Vega, \\nwhich implies that their premium is quite high in line with the high levels of volatility. Instead, \\ninvestors are looking for Alpha-generating investments that provide an additional return by \\noutperforming the market benchmarks. \\nAlpha is the  term used as a risk-adjusted measure of the return of an investment. The \\nAlpha of a fund is the term used to describe its performance relative to the risks taken. Alpha \\ncan be taken with respect to a relevant benchmark; with Alpha being higher, the better the \\nfund’s performance against the benchmark. This is referred to as Jensen’s Alpha, after Michael \\nJensen. Investors seeking Alpha traditionally turn to hedge funds or funds of hedge funds in \\nthe search for absolute returns, i.e. returns greater than those of the benchmark. Absolute \\nhedge funds would need to accomplish their objective of making proﬁts in the various market \\nenvironments, speciﬁcally, to still perform in falling and/or highly volatile market regimes. \\nIn rising markets they would also be expected to perform equally well as their benchmarks \\nand better. The search for Alpha led many investors to hedge funds in recent years; however, \\nhedge funds suffer from several drawbacks, including a lack of transparency, scalability and \\nliquidity. Capital preservation is also a consideration. \\nTo this end,  many investment banks, equipped with platforms that can handle cross-asset \\nclass risks, have sought to produce in-house hedge fund strategies , the goal being the delivery \\nof these as investment solutions to institutional investors seeking Alpha; an alternative to \\nhedge funds themselves. The products, also referred to as dynamic strategies, offer systematic \\nscalable Alpha-generating investments and aim to offer consistent positive performances over \\nset benchmarks at relatively low levels of volatility. The delivery of this strategy to the investor \\ncan take many forms including Delta-1, capital protected, etc., and these lend themselves to \\nthe standard set of possible wrappers. \\nA dynamic  strate gy is essentially a portfolio of assets in which the weights of the various \\nassets are periodically readjusted according to a transparently speciﬁed set of criteria. The \\ndesigner of the dynamic strategy thus plays the same role as the fund manager for an asset \\nmanagement product. Therefore, dynamic strategies are not only based on strong portfolio \\nmanagement and market behaviour concepts, as is the case for hedge funds, but they can also \\neliminate the aforementioned disadvantages. 330 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nFrom a marketing standpoint, the approach is similar to that used by actively managed \\nfunds. If the strategy is formally computed by an independent agent and its performance made \\navailable through data providers, then seeing the past performance and doing comparisons with \\nbenchmarks makes it easier for the investor, and simpliﬁes its marketing. As such it is typically \\nﬁrst marketed as a Delta-1 product with the possibility of offering it as a fund, note or option \\nbeing an additional feature. By providing investors in such products with regular updates on \\nthe weightings and performance of the strategy, one aims for subsequent reinvestments in the \\nstrategy, assuming the performance is as required. \\nWhen dynamic  strate gies are structured as an option, these payoffs typically remain simple \\nand do not exhibit a lot of convexities; the exotic nature of the product comes from the non-\\nstandard underlying:  the  dynamic strategy. The simple option structures make these products \\nmanageable from a trading standpoint, although it is possible to tailor the option on the \\nstrategy at the cost of a more complicated job of hedging. Dynamic strategies capture and \\nemphasize all the beneﬁts of the asset management business. Indeed, the higher the assets \\nunder management, the easier it is to make subsequent sales. Also, if a strategy performs well, \\nthere would be reinvestments by the investors. \\n21.2.2 Choosing the Assets  \\nThe three  most  commonly chosen assets are stocks, bonds and cash. Real estate and com-\\nmodities are among  other additional possibilities. Each of these possible assets has its own \\nunique set of risks, and once understood, it is these quite different risks that allow one to \\ncombine these assets to achieve an investment goal. Stocks, bonds and cash offer returns that \\nhave low historical correlations: economic factors under which one category thrives do not \\nnecessarily apply to the others. This means that combinations of these would serve well in a \\ndynamic strategy because it can potentially capture this feature and protect against large losses \\nwhile also generating consistent returns. Combining various asset classes is a step towards the \\nabsolute return objective and should allow for a low correlation to the equity markets among \\nother speciﬁc asset classes. \\nThe properties  of  stocks and bonds have been well discussed in this book and here we brieﬂy \\nreview property. As an asset class, property has over the years shown strong performance, and \\nshould be considered as a source of capital growth, despite the fact that the crash of 2008 \\nwas related to property. Historically, property has a quite low correlation to both bonds and \\nequities, which, along with its potentially high returns, makes it a good candidate as an asset \\nfor a dynamic strategy. Accessing the returns of property does not need to involve the actual \\npurchase of real estate (although it could). ETFs that track real estate indices are accessible \\nthrough equity markets, and there are also fund structures providing access to property. \\nLast but not  least is cash, or near cash, which is the asset class that preserves capital in the \\nshort and medium term. Although in some sense cash is more closely related to bonds than \\nthe other asset classes, cash has zero (or close to zero) realized correlation with the other asset \\nclasses. 21.2.3 Building the \\n Dynamic Strategy \\nThe Speciﬁcation  of  a Strategy \\nBefore building the  strategy, the rationale identiﬁes the assets that will be used as underlyings \\nfor the strategy, depending on market expectations. Also, the dynamic strategy should reﬂect /summationdisplay /summationdisplay \\n/summationtext \\n/summationdisplay 331 Dynamic Strategies  and Thematic Indices \\na speciﬁc trading philosophy that will impact the way it will be designed. Two popular trading \\nstrategies are the momentum and contrarian strategies. \\nMomentum trading  is  based on the observation of trading volumes. Once an asset shows \\na sudden surge in the traded volume, it is assumed to indicate an institutional interest in \\nthis asset. And because of the heavy buying power of ﬁnancial institutions, the demand for \\nthe asset will start growing, thus increasing its value. This move will be noticed by smaller \\ninvestors who will then start purchasing, which will further increase the asset price. The aim \\nof the momentum strategy is to analyse the trend and understand when and where to enter the \\nmarket. The idea behind this strategy is to enable the investor to ride the price movements and \\nclose the position before the conditions become adverse. The opposite also holds for declining \\nvalues of an asset’s price, which will be followed by a more negative trend. \\nContrarian strate gies  are based on going against the ﬂow. When the market seems to be \\ncrowding in some aspect, the contrarian sees this as an opportunity to ﬁnd misprices in \\nthe market place and take advantage accordingly. Too much pressure on an asset by market \\nparticipants, in either direction, can result in the asset being over- or underpriced. The contrarian \\nbuys the undervalued assets and sells the overvalued. Such strategies are typically different to \\nthose followed by the majority of investors. \\nThe idea behind  creating a dynamic strategy is to create a portfolio of assets that is dy-\\nnamically rebalanced.  This  means that the weights are recomputed periodically depending \\non prespeciﬁed rules; rebalancing rules that are made available to the investor. Modern dy-\\nnamic strate gies often  take the time dimension into account when deciding the asset allocation \\nrules. In doing so, these strategies are also incorporating information about the serial cross-\\ncorrelation, which is the correlation between one asset’s returns during a speciﬁc period and \\nanother asset’s returns during another period of time. \\nWeight Constr aints  and Rebalancing \\nIt is imperati ve that the speciﬁcation of rebalancing rules is systematic and transparent. To \\nclarify the building process of dynamic strategies, we assume that the strategy is based on n \\nassets. The weights of the assets are changed on a periodic basis to account for the previous \\nm periodical returns of each of the n assets. More precisely, each weight wi,t computed at \\ntime t is a linear combination of the previous m periodic returns of each of the n assets \\nwith ﬁxed coefﬁcients αi, j,k (n × m coefﬁcients for each asset composing the portfolio). For \\ni = 1, ..., n − 1, \\nwi,t = αi, j,k × Ri,t−k \\nj =1,..., n k=1,...,m \\nwhere Ri,k is the return of asset i at time t − k. And since i =1,..., n wi,t = 1 at any time t , \\nwn,t = 1 − wi,t \\ni=1,..., n−1 \\nThe above function is linear but it is important to understand that there are no constraints \\nabout the type of formula on which the weights are built. At this stage, the structurer may \\ndecide to add a series of constraints depending on the strategy rationale. For example, if one \\nof the assets is an equity index, its weight can be capped to (let’s say) 50%. This reduces the \\nmaximum equity exposure to 50% of the notional, thus decreasing the risk to equity markets. 332 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nThe weights of the components can also be ﬂoored or even negative, thus implying that the \\nstrategy allows short positions on speciﬁed assets. \\nIf the coef ﬁcients are taken to be positive, the strategy becomes momentum as in the sense \\nthat a positive coefﬁcient applied to a positive period’s return will increase the weight of \\nthe asset in the strategy. A negative return would decrease it. A contrarian strategy results \\nfrom negative coefﬁcients being applied to previous returns because a positive return of one \\nasset will lower its weighting and vice versa. Specifying a mixture of positive and negative \\ncoefﬁcients in the computation of the weights balances between these two strategies. \\nMost dynamic  strate gies aim to achieve high returns while keeping the volatility at low \\nlevels. For example, the structurer of the strategy can cap the level of volatility to a determined \\nlow level, say 10% annually, and maximize the return based on this level of volatility. Another \\nstrategy can be based on freezing the expected return (8% annually for instance) and mini-\\nmizing the v olatility. Once all the constraints and the objectives are determined, an optimizer \\nalgorithm will need to be utilized to solve for the weights formulas of the assets composing \\nthe strategy. Ultimately, dynamic strategies are managed in the same way as funds. There are \\nspeciﬁc rebalancing dates at which the trader buys/sells speciﬁed quantities of the assets in \\norder to adjust the different weights, depending on the rebalancing formula. \\nThe dynamic  strate gy itself is regarded as an exotic underlying, and the option payoffs \\nstructured on dynamic strategies are typically simple in nature. One example is the investor \\nwho is bullish on the underlying dynamic strategy, but speciﬁcally on its ability to outperform \\na benchmark index. In this case an outperformance option can be structured on the return of the \\ndynamic strategy versus this benchmark. Another example is the call option where the investor \\nis essentially paying a premium in exchange for a no-downside exposure to the strategy. Note \\nthat the seller of a call option on the strategy, who will need to go long Delta in the underlying \\nstrategy, must be long wi × /Delta1i for each asset i with these weights changing through time. \\nLikewise for the individual Vegas that may need to be dynamically adjusted. If the strategy \\nallows for negative weights, then the cost of shorting the assets, i.e. borrow costs, must also \\nbe factored in. \\nSince most  of  the strategies present quite low levels of volatility, it is cheap to issue options \\non such indices, and this makes investing in notes based on dynamic strategies a deﬁnite pos-\\nsibility. A management  fee is typically charged on an annual basis for providing this exposure \\nto the investor, and is typically a ﬁxed percentage of notional. This will at least cover the trans-\\naction costs  incurred  by the seller and reﬂect the cost of hedging the exposure to the strategy. \\nThe seller  of  an option on a rebalancing strategy may be exposed to gap risk, which would \\nbe the result of a large move in one underlying followed accordingly by a signiﬁcant shift in \\nthe weights of the index at the next rebalancing date. To price this, one would need to use a \\nmodel that allows for jumps in the paths of the risky assets of the strategy. This risk can be \\nat least partially hedged using options, possibly short maturity OTM put options in the case \\nof downside jumps. An estimation of the gap risk within the strategy leads to the selection of \\nthese hedging options. Cliquet puts can also serve this purpose, with period to period resets \\nmatching the rebalancing dates; the cheaper option being cliquet put spreads. Whether this risk \\nis to be hedged or not, it should be estimated and priced into the charge of the management fee. \\n21.3 THEMATIC PRODUCTS \\nA thematic product is a ﬁnancial product whose underlying is constructed on the basis of \\na speciﬁc theme, for example a “green stocks” or “clean energy”. An underlying can be 333 Dynamic Strategies  and Thematic Indices \\nconstructed to represent these and provide exposure to the theme via equities. Typically this \\nwill take on the form of a dynamic index where the selection of the underlying basket is based \\non a theme, and the (dynamic) weights given by some set of rules. The idea is to strike a \\nbalance between providing the investor with the most representative and relevant exposure \\nto the required theme, and at the same time construct an index on which options can be \\nrealistically written and hedged. 21.3.1 Demand for Thematic Products \\nThe\\n demand  for  such a product starts with an investor’s view. This may be based on the \\nconclusion of research regarding, for example, the prospects of certain emerging markets, or \\nthe increase in the global demand for food, and serve as the investment vehicle to express these \\nconclusions. The reason behind considering a thematic index, compared to a static basket, is \\nthat the optimal entry into a basket of assets (whose weights are ﬁxed all the way to maturity) \\nmay represent the desired view today, but may not do so in the future. A thematic index can \\nallow for a dynamic allocation that rebalances to ensure consistency with the theme .W en o w \\nconsider an emerging markets theme and a green energy theme to illustrate. \\nExample: Emer ging  Markets \\nThe term emer ging generally refers to an economy that is undergoing industrialization and \\ngrowth at a fast pace. Investing in emerging markets can provide very large returns: recent \\ntimes have seen some emerging market indices grow by over 60% for some consecutive years. \\nHowever, this comes at a price: the returns on emerging market indices can be dangerously \\nvolatile. Other problems that investors face when trying to access such markets include the \\nlack of transparency in corporate decisions and relatively poor liquidity. \\nAn emer ging mark et index, for example, can be constructed to provide an investor with \\nequity exposure to various emerging economies. The idea behind this thematic index is that \\nas economic factors change, the weights in such an index can be adjusted according to some \\nmethodology to reﬂect these changes. The weights of the countries considered within the \\nindex can be selected to reﬂect factors including political stability, laws and regulations, and \\neconomic conditions, in order to provide the investor with a dynamic exposure to an equity \\nbasket with lots of potential growth. As these conditions improve (or deteriorate) in a country, \\nits weight in the index can be increased (or decreased respectively). The emerging market’s \\ntheme provides a good example throughout this section. \\nExample: Green  Energy \\nAnother example is  a green energy theme, by which the investor can take a view on a group of \\nequities that are in some way involved in the development of green energy technologies. Green \\nenergy refers to energy sources that are environmentally less polluting than traditional energy \\nsources such as oil. The view is that oil is a ﬁnite commodity, and environmental concerns and \\nregulations will lead to an increased demand for green energy. This will translate to equity \\ngains in the long run – assuming the product correctly reﬂects this. \\nAn index with  this theme would include ﬁrms that are involved in research and development \\nof green energy technologies. To be included, such ﬁrms will need to have a minimum per-\\ncentage (for e xample 50%) of their revenues being generated from green energy involvement. 334 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nGreen energy has several subsectors and the index can be structured to balance equally amongst \\nthem or possibly focus on some more than others. \\n21.3.2 Structuring a Thematic  Index \\nAssume we started  with a universe of possible assets to create a thematic index, and from \\nthese made a selection of a starting basket, with the possibility of adding more from this \\nuniverse according to some methodology. The weighting in such an index must follow a preset \\nmethodology, i.e. a ﬁxed set of constraints, known as the index methodology . \\nFor example: assume  there are 50 assets that represent the theme, from which we will select \\n20 to be in our starting basket. The index methodology can, for example, limit the minimum \\namount of assets to be 10 and the maximum to be 50. The target volatility of the index should \\nstay within the range 15–45% for example. The target equivalent dividend yield on the index \\ncan be in the range 1.5–4.5% for example. The weights of the assets should additionally be \\ncapped so that no component has more than 15% of the weight of the basket. \\nIn the case  of an emerging market index, we have a great deal of uncertainty regarding future \\ndividends and so a broad target range as above would be reasonable to set. The assets are also \\ntypically quite volatile, and again a wide range as above would be reasonable. If the index \\nconsisted of multiple countries then the weight on any one country should also be capped to \\nensure that the index is not biased towards one country. The cap will depend on how many \\ncountries are to be included; for example, if there are 10, then it is unreasonable to have more \\nthan 20% on one country. A thematic index providing equity exposure to Africa cannot have, \\nsay, 50% weight on South Africa and still be considered a thematic product for the whole \\ncontinent. Additionally, the various sectors should also be capped: communication, banking, \\nenergy, etc., to again provide some balance. The caps are to ensure that the investor will, \\nthroughout the life of the exposure to the thematic index, always gain a balanced exposure to \\nthe said theme. \\nLiquidity is also  a concern, especially when emerging markets are involved, and there should \\nalso be a liquidity constraint on the assets being considered as constituents in the index. The \\nindex methodology should include a minimum requirement of liquidity. If a market were to \\nbecome more transparent and liquid, then it would again be favoured during the index review. \\nAn increased market capitalization of a speciﬁc ﬁrm within the index will also be considered as \\na criterion for increasing its weight. We see this below as an important factor when considering \\npricing options on such an index. \\nThe frequenc y  of the rebalancing of the index will be speciﬁed in its methodology. For \\nexample, one can have annual or semi-annual index reviews, where the asset constituents are \\nreweighted according to the theme via the methodology. In the case of the emerging market a \\nconsiderable improvement in the political situation can make one country favourable in terms \\nof potential growth and its weight increased. In the green energy theme, a constituent company \\nmay be deriving income from other sources and focusing less on green energy, thus making \\nit unsuitable for inclusion in a green energy theme. Other companies may also have emerged \\nwith green energy as a large part of their revenue, and can then be considered for addition \\nto the universe of the thematic index. An unanticipated corporate event can be grounds for \\nmaking a non-scheduled adjustment to the index, and the creator of the thematic index would \\ntypically reserve the right to do so, based on some criteria. \\nThe index can  be made into a composite index , following the concept behind the composite \\noption of Chapter 20. An emerging market thematic index, which involves equities from various 335 Dynamic Strategies  and Thematic Indices \\ncountries denominated in different currencies, can be set to be composite USD, for example \\n(or another currency). The speciﬁcation of the composite currency will have an impact on how \\nthe index looks in a back-test, and can be set according to investors’ preferences. Additionally, \\nto make the index more appealing from a marketing perspective, the index methodology can \\nbe written in order to make the back-test look optimal. For example, increasing the number of \\nassets by adding de-correlated assets within the theme, if available, to the index will provide \\na diversiﬁcation effect and lower the volatility of the index. \\n21.3.3 Structured Products  on Thematic Indices \\nOnce there  is  such an index we can discuss the products that are possible using it as \\nthe underlying asset. In theory any payout is possible, but here we are in the realm of an \\nexotic underlying, and the general trend is for relatively simple payouts. The reason is that \\nthe underlying should itself encapsulate the investor’s view, not a complex payout. By buying \\nan option on a thematic index, the investor gets, in one transaction, exposure to the theme \\nin which they wish to invest, avoiding the time and transaction costs involved in maintaining \\nsuch an exposure themselves. \\nSince the deri vatives are simple, marketing a simple derivative on such an index is all \\nabout the underlying itself, and a back-test reﬂecting its performance both in absolute terms \\nand comparatively with similar assets is key. Additionally, if the index is formally computed \\nby an independent agent and the results given by data providers, this makes seeing its past \\nperformance and doing comparisons easier for the investor, and simpliﬁes its marketing. \\nA straight  e xposure to an index can be in the form of a Delta-1 product, or some form \\nof leveraged forward (recall section 3.10). In the simple leveraged forward the investor is \\nlong a call option (upside potential) and short a put option (downside risk). These can \\nhave the same strike or different strikes reﬂecting different risk appetites. The participa-\\ntions are not  necessarily equal and the investor may only want 50% participation in the \\ndownside in order to enhance the participation in the upside. If they are both set at 100% \\nparticipation, and the strike is ATM, then the investor is exposed with a participation of \\n100% to both the gains and potential losses in the thematic index. In this case there is no \\noptionality. \\nThe investor who  is looking to protect capital and not assume any downside risk can buy \\na call option on such a thematic index, pay the up-front premium, and from then on only \\nhave upside participation in the index. Essentially we have at our disposal in this case all the \\ntools of section 3.10 for structuring the option that best provides the investor with the required \\nexposure, and at a required price. In the case of emerging markets, we generally expect high \\nlevels of volatility, making a call option on such an index relatively expensive. Averaging or \\ncaps can be used to reduce the prices of these vanilla combinations, and features such as capital \\nprotection can be offered by including the option in a note. One can in this case also consider \\npayoffs such as those in section 3.10, where the investor is short volatility. \\n21.3.4 Pricing Options  on  Thematic Indices \\nThe above discussion  focuses on the investor’s point of view and requirements for exposure. \\nOne can build a thematic index that genuinely provides the best possible exposure to the \\ntheme at hand, and have a methodology by which the investor’s view on the theme will be \\ncontinuously represented through adjusting the weights. Once an option has been speciﬁed, 336 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\ntaking as underlying a thematic index, the question is how does the seller of an option on \\nsuch an index price and hedge such a position? The strategy will be to model the index as a \\nsingle asset, combining the properties of the assets, and accounting for the changes regarding \\nreweighting according to the index methodology. \\nIf we start  with a Black–Scholes environment, assuming a log-normal process for the \\nunderlying index, we must specify the risk-neutral drift and the volatility of the process. \\nThe drift in this case will need to encompass information regarding the risk-free rates in the \\ncurrencies in which the underlying’s constituents are denominated, information regarding the \\ndividend yields of these assets, and additionally any quanto adjustments that are necessary. \\nThese inputs will have a large impact on the Delta of the option, but in order to Delta hedge \\nwe must ultimately have a minimum amount of liquidity in the assets. \\nLiquidity In situations  such\\n  as the emerging market example, liquidity is a key concern when pricing \\noptions on such an index. Delta hedging involves the buying and selling of the underlying \\nassets, and we must be able to sufﬁciently trade them in order to Delta hedge efﬁciently. \\nFor a stock to be considered liquid means that one must be able to buy and sell its stock \\nwithout moving the price of the stock. In some emerging markets where little volume is \\ntraded, it is difﬁcult to buy Delta of stock without moving its price, and so during the con-\\nstruction and subsequent  index reviews the seller may impose a minimum amount of liquidity \\nrequirement to make pricing possible. This can be done by ﬂooring the daily traded volume \\nat, for example, 10 or 15 million USD, conservatively, and as such there should be sufﬁ-\\ncient liquidity  to  Delta hedge. Problems with liquidity come from large bid–ask spreads on \\ncertain stocks, and these are generally associated with low volumes, and if such a stock is \\nto be used, one must price a cost into the price, as a cost will be incurred during Delta \\nhedging. \\nSometimes companies  ha ve shares that are listed on their local market as well as on a foreign \\nmarket, and the choice of which to include in a thematic index would be the one with the most \\nliquidity. We may be able to ﬁnd American Depository Receipts (ADRs) for some foreign \\ncompanies. The holder of an ADR is essentially long a number of shares in a foreign company \\nthat is trading on a US exchange. By buying an ADR, compared to accessing a foreign market \\nand buying the stock there, the investor bypasses the transaction costs involved with trading \\nin a foreign market. The ADR’s price is in USD and pays dividends in USD. This, and the \\nfact that the ADR is traded through US markets like a local US stock, means that the ADR \\ncarries some basis risk, but this can be charged for up front. These can prove particularly \\nuseful in the case of some illiquid market products, and if the ADR for a particular stock is \\nmore liquid than the stock itself in its local market, then the ADR should be used in place of \\nthe stock. \\nGlobal Depository  Receipts  (GDRs) are similar to ADRs but are traded through the London \\nStock Exchange. Again the holder of a GDR is long a number of shares in a foreign company, \\nand if these are more liquid than the foreign stock, especially in an emerging market, these \\nmay be used instead of the stock itself. Additionally to these two, if one is able to trade futures \\non an index – for example, on the equity index of an emerging market that has constituents in \\nthe thematic index – then this adds additional liquidity. As discussed in Chapter 5, futures or \\nother assets can be used in Delta hedging in place of the underlying. 337 Dynamic Strategies  and Thematic Indices \\nDividends Assuming that liquidity\\n  in the constituent assets is sufﬁcient to Delta hedge, we must look at \\nthe uncertainty in the dividends. Firstly, the index methodology will have a dividend target \\nthat should be met, and the rebalancing will take this into account, but especially in the case of \\nemerging markets, there is a large uncertainty surrounding future dividend yields. Problems \\nstemming from tax or regulatory issues in some foreign countries may imply that the holder \\nof a foreign stock may not receive 100% of dividends paid, and because the seller of a call \\noption is long Delta of stock and thus long dividends, one must adjust for this before pricing. \\nOne can simply take a haircut on the dividend yield to counter this and the uncertainty coming \\nfrom the lack of transparency in some emerging market corporate policies. In some cases, for \\nexample that of the green theme described above, it may be possible to hedge dividend risks \\nusing dividend swaps if the assets are all traded on major exchanges. \\nManagement Fee  \\nIf an annual  management fee is being charged for maintaining the index, and explicitly for \\noffering an option on such an index, then this must be included in the pricing. Assuming \\nthat this is a constant percentage f , typically within the range of 50 bps to 2% per annum, \\nwith higher values corresponding to greater complexity in the underlying index, then this can \\nbe subtracted from the risk free rate in the drift to make the adjustment. The analogy is an \\nunderlying stock that pays an annual dividend of f %, and the impact of this on the pricing is \\nthe same as including the annual fee of f %. \\nComposite Adjustment  \\nA\\n back-test  is  essentially a time series containing the previous path of the thematic index, and \\nif, when conducting a back-test, the index is to be composite then we must adjust for this. At \\neach stage where returns are considered, generally at the daily close of each stock, then if the \\nindex is to be composite USD for example, each stock’s price must be changed to its price \\nin USD at this point in time. This is done by simply multiplying each day’s closing price by \\nthe USD exchange rate with the currency in which the stock is denominated. The composite \\nindex will then be adjusted by the volatility of the FX rate. \\nV olatility The composite  inde\\n x’s time series can then be used to compute the realized volatility of the \\nindex. One can consider for example the 100-day realized volatility of the time series, as far \\nback as it can go, with more relevance placed on the more recent period’s realized volatility. \\nEven if we had implied volatilities for all the constituent assets, using these to compute \\nthe current implied volatility of the index as a basket would require implied correlations \\nthat we do not have. As such we need a method for pricing and hedging the volatility of \\nthe index. \\nIn many cases,  we may be unable to ﬁnd liquid quotes on the options of the underlying \\nstocks. In this case we ﬁnd a proxy index or ETF on which we can trade options, and consider \\na volatility spread between the thematic index and the proxy index, or ETF. We know the \\ntime series of the proxy, and thus know its realized volatility. Plotted as a time series against 338 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nthe realized volatility of the thematic index, one can observe the spread between the two. If \\nthe proxy is sufﬁciently related to the thematic index then these two will generally follow \\nsimilar paths, and, if so, one can consider the average of the difference between the two series. \\nAssuming that this is not too far from the extreme cases, and that the variance of this spread is \\nquite low, one can use this spread to imply the volatility of the thematic index from the proxy \\nETF or index. \\nAn ETF, or  another index, can serve as a Vega hedge proxy for a thematic index, providing \\nwe can trade options on it. One compares its realized volatility series with that of the thematic \\nindex. If we obtain a spread of 4% between the volatilities, the ETFs (or the indexes) being \\nthe higher, then we use the implied volatilities from the options on the ETF (or index) and \\nsubtract this spread. This may be particularly relevant if the options on this ETF or index are \\nto be used to Vega hedge an option position in the thematic index. The implied volatility of \\nthe option on the proxy used should have a maturity equal to that of the option being priced \\non the thematic index. From here the volatility to use in pricing is dependent on the nature \\nof the payoff. The payoff governs whether the seller is short or long volatility, and a bid–ask \\nspread is taken around the computed level of volatility accordingly, and as aggressively or \\nconservatively as required. \\nIn the case  of an ATM call option, we are not overly concerned about skew, but in the case \\nof a skew-dependent payoff, for example a call spread, we must price this skew. An index’s \\nskew is more pronounced than those of single stocks, so if we have an index as a proxy we can \\nuse its skew knowing that this is conservative (in the case where the seller is short skew). In the \\ncase of the green energy theme this may be possible, especially if the underlying constituents \\nare in some of the major global indices. Appendices Appendix A \\nModels \\nA.1 BLACK–SCHOLES \\nA.1.1 Black–Scholes SDE \\nIn\\n the Black–Scholes  model, the price of the underlying is modelled as a log-normal random \\nvariable. The stochastic differential equation (SDE) governing the dynamics of the price is \\ngiven by \\ndS(t)  =rS(t)dt +σS(t)dWt \\nwhere r is the risk-free rate, and σ the volatility of the underlying. Like a typical SDE, \\nthis equation consists of a deterministic part and a random part. The part dS(t ) =rS(t )dt \\nis a deterministic, ordinary differential equation, which can be written as dS\\nd(\\ntt) =rS(t). The \\naddition of the term σS(t)dWt introduces randomness into the equation, making it stochastic. \\nThe random part contains the term Wt , which is Brownian motion; it is a random process that \\nis normally distributed with mean zero and variance t. The assumption of a log-normal price \\nimplies that log prices are normally distributed. The log is another way of expressing returns, \\nso in a different way this is saying that if the price is log-normally distributed, then the returns \\nof the underlying are normally distributed. \\nA.1.2 Black–Scholes PDE  \\nW\\ne know the  payoff of an option C(S,T ) at maturity T , but to know its value at a time t <T \\nwe need to understand how C evolves as a function of S and T . The price of the option C (S,T ) \\nsatisﬁes a partial differential equation (PDE). If we make Black–Scholes assumptions, then \\nthe PDE it satisﬁes is the Black–Scholes PDE given by \\n∂C 12 S2 ∂2C ∂C + σ +rS −rC  =0 ∂t 2  ∂S2 ∂S \\nThe parameter  r  is the continuously compounded risk-free rate of interest, σ> 0i st h e \\nvolatility of the stock, and t >0 is the time to maturity of the stock option. \\nIn the case  of a call option, the above PDE is satisﬁed and the following boundary conditions \\nare imposed \\n• C(0,t) =0  for all t \\n• C(S,t) → S  as S →∞ \\n• C(S,T )  =max( S −K ,0) \\nThese all mak e intuitive sense to us. If the spot goes to zero, the call’s payout is zero, whatever \\nthe time remaining. If the spot gets arbitrarily large, then we know the option is ITM and its \\nprice will grow at the same rate as the spot. The third condition is simply the payoff of the \\ncall that we want the price to satisfy at maturity. If we solve this PDE using these boundary /parenrightbigg 342 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nconditions, then the result is of course the Black–Scholes formula for the price of the call \\noption. \\nThis PDE can be rewritten in terms of the Greeks as \\n1 /Theta1 + σ  2 S2/Gamma1 + rS/Delta1 − rC = 0 2 \\nAs we ha ve seen before, the assumption of zero rates (r = 0) gives the relationship between \\n/Theta1 and /Gamma1. \\nA.2 LOCAL VOLATILITY MODELS \\nLocal volatility refers to the term σ (S(t), t) which appears in the random part of the SDE \\ndS(t)  = rS(t)dt + σ (S(t), t)dWt \\ndescribing the evolution of a stock price. The case where σ (S(t), t) = σ S(t), where σ is a \\nconstant, is simply the Black–Scholes case. The drift term is the same as the Black–Scholes \\ncase, and it contains the risk-free rate r in light of the fact that we are still working in a \\nrisk-neutral world. \\nThe ﬁrst thing  to note is that although the function σ (S(t), t) can imply various distributions, \\nthe local volatility model is still driven by only one source of randomness: Wt, Brownian \\nmotion. The idea is to search for this set of coefﬁcients σ (S(t), t) so that if we used this diffusion \\nto price European options, we would get back the market data. Finding these coefﬁcients is \\nessentially calibrating the local volatility model. \\nThe PDE  satisﬁed  by the price of a call option under the local volatility model is given by \\n∂C 1  ∂2C ∂C + σ 2(S(t), t) + rS − rC = 0 (A.1) ∂t 2  ∂ S2 ∂ S \\nGiven a set  of call options of various strikes and maturities, a surface translates to a set of \\nprices of call options C(T, K). The existence of the diffusion coefﬁcients σ (S(t), t) that will \\nreturn these prices was proved by Dupire (1994; see also Wilmott, 2000). In essence, we are \\nasking the question: Is there a distribution such that if we write the payoffs of vanillas as \\nexpected values, given this distribution, can it return all the correct prices of vanillas? Dupire’s \\nequation states: \\n1 ∂C(K, T) ∂C(T, K)  = σ 2(K, T; S0)K2 ∂2C(K, T) + (r −  D) /parenleftbigg \\nC(T, K)  − K ∂ T 2  ∂ K2 ∂ K \\nWriting the equation  in terms of the forward to remove the drift terms (Gatheral, 2006), we \\nget \\n∂C(FT , T, K) 12(K, T; S0)K2 ∂2C(FT , K, T) = σ ∂ T 2  ∂ K2 \\nAll the terms are known except σ 2(K, T; S0), which can be solved via this equation. To obtain \\nan entire and meaningful distribution, we must have liquid quotes for options of different \\nstrikes and maturities. In practice, problems can arise when searching for this distribution, and \\ntechniques involving maximum entropy, for example, can be applied. \\nOne debate  re garding local volatility is that even though it is a one-factor model that allows \\nfor a calibration to implied volatility surfaces, the dynamics implied by these models do not 343 Appendix A: Models  \\nnecessarily match those observed empirically. Assuming that we ﬁt an implied skew today, \\nand the underlying moves, how does the implied volatility in the market move, and how does \\nthe implied volatility generated by a local volatility model move? This is important from a \\nhedging point of view: the Greeks computed via a model differ depending on the various \\nmodel assumptions. If an option’s price is sensitive to skew, then skew must be included when \\ncomputing the Delta of an option for example. Delta measures the sensitivity to a move in price, \\nbut if the model predicts the skew to move in an opposite manner to that of the market, then the \\nDelta will be wrong. In fact there are cases where a naive non-skew Black–Scholes Delta may \\nbe better. Traders will typically adjust the Deltas anyway based on their assumption of whether \\nthe skew follows the sticky strike or sticky Delta rules, or some interpolation of these two. \\nA.3 STOCHASTIC VOLA TILITY \\nStochastic volatility models are needed when pricing structure with non-trivial Vega \\nconvexity – for example, the Napoleon structure of Chapter 14. We use Heston’s model \\nas an example and work through some issues. \\nA.3.1 Heston’s Model  \\nHeston’\\ns model  (Heston,  1993) is a popular stochastic volatility model, particularly for equity \\nderivatives. In Heston, the underlying stock price is modelled as a random process and its \\nvariance is also modelled as a random process. In essence this means that the variance is \\nstochastic, but for the majority of our concerns this is acceptable. The two-factor model implies \\ndynamics that are not log-normal and it can generate implied volatility skews and surfaces that \\nare consistent with those observed in the market. The model allows for an arbitrary correlation \\nbetween the underlying’s price process and that of its variance, and additionally, as the title \\nof Heston’s paper suggests, there exist semi-closed form solutions for the prices of European \\noptions under this model. Having such formulas is what makes calibration to a surface of \\nvanillas tractable. \\nIn its basic  form, the Heston model describes the evolution of the two processes according \\nto the following set of SDEs: \\n√dSt = µSt dt + νtSt dWt √ dνt = κ(θ − νt )dt + σ ν t dZt \\nwhere νt is the instantaneous variance, and dWt and dZt are Brownian motions with \\ncorrelation ρ . \\nThe ﬁrst feature  to note is that the variance is modelled by a mean-reverting process. The \\nterm κ(θ − νt )dt in the drift of the variance governs how it reverts: θ is the long-term variance \\nto which this process reverts, and κ is the rate at which it reverts to this mean. Empirical \\nvolatilities and variances generally mean-revert over time, and so this modelling assumption \\nis quite realistic. \\nThe term σ  is the vol-of-vol term, to be precise it is the vol-of-var, and it governs the \\nvolatility of the process for the variance. The correlation ρ is the coefﬁcient that governs joint \\nmovements in the stock and its variance. As such we expect that if implemented correctly, then \\nσ will inﬂuence the curvature of the implied volatilities: a higher σ will mean more curvature \\nin the implied volatilities. Also, ρ will inﬂuence the skew on the implied volatilities – the more \\nnegative ρ is, the steeper the skew. 344 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nThe time t price of a call option C (S0, K ,v0,t, T ), with maturity T , under Heston’s model \\nsatisﬁes the partial differential equation (Heston, 1993): \\n∂C S2 v ∂2C ∂C + + (r −  d)S − (r − d)C ∂t 2  ∂S2 ∂S \\n∂C σ2 v ∂2C ∂2C + [κ(θ − v) − λv] + + ρσv S = 0 ∂v 2 ∂v2 ∂S ∂v \\nWe can immediately  see additional terms to the Black–Scholes PDE due to the variance being \\ntaken as a random process. Firstly, the term σ\\n22 v ∂2 C is the Vega convexity term. By allowing ∂v2 \\nfor the variance to be stochastic, the pricing PDE that the option prices must involve a Vega \\nconvexity term. As such, the model knows about Vega convexity, whereas the local volatility \\nabove does not (no terms regarding the volatility or variance appear in equation (A.1)). A \\nsimilar term will appear in ANY other stochastic volatility. \\nAdditionally, the term  ρσv S ∂2 C is the Vanna term, which governs the joint movements ∂S∂v \\nin both, as is clear from the mixed partial derivative. The correlation term ρ appears in front \\nof this term of the PDE only. In equities, we know that the skew is downward sloping, and \\nthis will be reﬂected in the calibration as we will ﬁnd a suitable calibrated value for ρ to be \\nnegative. This is consistent with what we observe empirically: as the underlying moves down, \\nvolatility (or variance) moves up. In the case of FX where we observe a smile, we expect \\npositive values for ρ . \\nDespite all these  parameters, the Heston model, and similar stochastic volatility models, \\nstruggle to provide good calibrations to an entire surface. In particular, it struggles to ﬁt both \\nthe short end of the skew and the long end simultaneously. This can be remedied with the \\naddition of jumps, discussed below. \\nV olatility Derivatives in  Heston’s Model \\nHeston’s model  considers  the variance of the underlying to be stochastic, satisfying the SDE \\n√ dνt = κ(θ − νt )dt + σ ν t dWt \\nIt is possible to obtain a closed form for the price of the variance swap of Chapter 16 – \\ncomputing the fair strike that is. This is given by the expectation of the annualized total \\nvariance, which computed to \\n1 /bracketleftbigg/integraldisplay T /bracketrightbigg \\nE [Annualized Total Variance ] = E νt dt T 0 \\ne−κT + 1 = (θ  − ν0) + θ κT \\nThis\\n result  only  involves the drift terms of the variance – not the vol-of-vol or the stock/variance \\ncorrelation. This makes sense because the price of the variance swap should depend on the \\nprices of European options – not modelling-dependent assumptions. The Delta of the variance \\nswap under Heston is zero, because the underlying spot price does not appear in this equation. \\nAdditionally, we can compute the convexity adjustment in Heston’s model needed to price \\nvolatility swaps. As we saw in Chapter 16 the volatility swap cannot be replicated in a similar \\nfashion to the variance swap. Thus a model is needed, and the price is a function of the model’s \\nassumptions. 345 Appendix A: Models  \\nFor a more in-depth discussion of Heston’s model we refer the reader to Gatheral (2006), \\nwhich offers a treatment of all aspects of the model, speciﬁcally those relating to volatility \\nderivatives. Implementation and calibration details are discussed by Mikhailov and Nogel \\n(2005). Further details regarding volatility derivatives in the Heston model are found in Sepp \\n(2008), most importantly, analytical formulas for options on realized variance. \\nA.3.2 The SABR  Model  \\nSABR is a  stochastic volatility model pioneered in Hagan et al. (2002) with the aim of capturing \\nthe correct dynamics of the implied volatility smile. The model describes the evolution of a \\nsingle forward, such as a forward LIBOR rate or a forward FX rate. The volatility of this \\nforward is taken as a random process as well, making it a stochastic volatility model. The \\nforward and its volatility evolve according to the set of SDEs given by \\ndF ( t ) = α(t)F β(t)dWt \\ndα(t ) = να(t)dZt \\nwhere Wt and Zt are two correlated Brownian motions, with correlation coefﬁcient \\n−1 <ρ < 1. \\nThe ﬁrst line  describes the evolution of the forward process, and this is in fact a local \\nvolatility known as the Constant Elasticity of V ariance , or CEV . The β has the constraint \\n0 ≤ β ≤ 1 in the SABR model, and the CEV part, F (t)β, can be anything between the cases \\nof β = 0 which is a Normal model, and β = 1 which gives the log-normal model. In fact, \\nif we take the parameter ν in the second equation to be zero, then the volatility α becomes \\ndeterministic; therefore in this case, taking β = 1 reduces this to the Black–Scholes SDE for \\na forward. This parameter ν is called the vol-of-vol because it is the coefﬁcient in the random \\npart of the volatility. \\nThe volatility in  the SABR model is driftless, and is assumed to be log-normal. In contrast \\nwith Heston where the variance term has a drift that makes sure it reverts back to the long-\\nrun mean, in SABR there is no such mean-reverting drift. This may not make sense at ﬁrst, \\nthat one models volatility as a log-normal process with no mean reversion, especially since \\nwe know that volatilities are empirically mean-reverting. However, the SABR model is not \\ntrying to capture the dynamics of long-term volatilities. The model is the simplest extension \\nof the Black–Scholes model that knows about volatility smiles and skews, and gives correct \\nsmile dynamics. The model’s simplicity allows for a quite accurate, intuitive and closed-form \\nsolution (given in section 17.1.8) that is perhaps its greatest strength. \\nThe SABR  formula  is derived by solving the PDE associated with the price of a call option \\nunder the SABR model. The PDE is simpler than Heston’s because of the absence of drift terms. \\nThe method used to solve the PDE is an asymptotic method, which means that the solution is \\nnot exact, but is quite accurate for certain conditions. In the SABR model this condition is that \\nν2t (vol-of-vol squared × time to expiration) is small. The result of the asymptotic expansion \\nis a volatility that can be used in conjunction with Black–Scholes formula. This volatility \\ninvolves all the parameters of the model: β,ρ,ν , the initial values we know from the market \\nfor F0 and α0, and the strike of the option. When used as the volatility in the Black–Scholes \\nmodel, it returns the SABR price of an option. The fact that the model is solved in terms of the \\nimplied volatility generated by the model, means that calibration to implied volatilities in the \\nmarket can be done directly. Additionally, useable formulas for the probability distribution in 346 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nthe SABR model have been derived, making it relatively easy to use the model in a copula. \\nFor useable formulas and derivations of the probability distribution of the SABR model, we \\nrefer to Hagan et al. (2005). \\nThe SABR  formula  is an excellent approximation in the case of ATM options, but its accu-\\nracy deteriorates  as  we go to deep OTM call options. The reality is that these options, in the \\ncase of CMSs for example, must be priced correctly. The SABR volatility formula can diverge \\nas we go deep OTM when in reality the implied volatilities of these options should converge to \\na constant. Nonetheless, these problems in the wings can be remedied, possibly by reparame-\\nterizing the implied  volatility formula of SABR to be constant beyond certain levels of strikes. \\nA.4 JUMP MODELS \\nAs we know, the returns in equity markets exhibit fat tails. The assumption of log-normality \\nis not observed and we seem to have an equity skew. One way to explain this is to consider \\njump models. A jump component can be added to some of the models we know in order to \\nmake them more realistic by allowing the underlying’s price to jump . The inclusion of jumps \\nhelps to explain the short end of the skew and allows models to be better calibrated to this end \\nof the skew. Recall the discussion in Chapter 4. \\nMerton’s jump-dif fusion  system (see Merton, 1976) models the asset’s price by a Brownian \\nmotion with drift, as in the case of Black–Scholes, but additionally with a compound Poisson \\nprocess to model the jumps. The corresponding SDE, in a jump-diffusion setting, is \\ndS = (α  − λk)dt + σ dWt + dqtS \\nHere α is  the instantaneous expected return on the asset price, S; σ is the instantaneous \\nvariance of the return when the Poisson event does not occur; dWt is a standard Brownian \\nmotion; and qt is the independent Poisson process. The diffusion part models small movements \\nin the underlying, and the jump portion adds randomly occurring large movements, i.e. jumps. \\nMarket crashes are often characterized by large downward jumps, which must be modelled by \\na jump process as these large moves are not typical of standard diffusions. \\nBates’s model (see Bates, 1996) is essentially a Heston model plus jumps similar to those \\nof Merton. As such, it allows for both stochastic volatility and jumps. The result is that the \\nBates model can be much better ﬁt to an entire surface: the jumps are used to explain the short \\nmaturity skew, and the stochastic volatility the longer end of the skew. Separately, either of \\nthese models would struggle – the stochastic volatility model to ﬁt the short end and the jump \\nmodel to explain the long end – but combined they complement each other well. \\nA.5 HULL–WHITE INTEREST RATE MODEL AND EXTENSIONS \\nOne popular short-rate model, as mentioned in Chapter 20 in the context of interest rate \\nmodels, is the Hull–White model (see Hull and White, 1990). The original Hull–White model \\nis also known as the “extended Vasicek” because it models the short rate with a (modiﬁed) \\nVasicek process: \\ndr (t ) = (θ (t ) − κ(t )r (t )) dt + σ (t )dW (t ) \\nFirstly, notice  that  the drift term is similar to that of the variance in Heston’s model: it is \\nmean-reverting. Again this is a valuable property of the model because interest rates are /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg 347 Appendix A: Models  \\ngenerally mean-reverting, and if one has to assign a drift, this is a reasonable choice. The drift \\n(θ (t ) −κ(t )r (t )) dt can be written as \\nθ (t)κ(t) −r (t) dt κ(t ) \\nand the interpretation  of the parameters of long-run mean and reversion rate are clear. \\nIt is the  addition of these time-dependent parameters in the process that generalizes the \\nVasicek process, and in fact makes the model more applicable. The time-dependent drift \\nfunction θ (t ) is typically chosen so that the model gives an exact ﬁt to today’s observed yield \\ncurve. Closed forms for bond prices are given in terms of this function and the rest of the model \\nparameters, see Hull and White (1990). The parameter σ (t ) is taken to be time dependent so \\nthat the model has more ﬂexibility to also ﬁt the implied volatilities of swaptions or caplets. \\nFrom an implementation  standpoint, the fact that this model can be placed onto a pricing \\ntree or lattice makes it particularly useful for products such as Bermudan swaptions whose \\npricing requires some form of backward induction. As neat as this may be, the model suffers \\nfrom the problems mentioned in Chapter 20 in that the forward rates are perfectly correlated in \\nthese models. This makes them unsuited for pricing applications that have sensitivities to the \\ncorrelation between forward rates. One possible way around this, and a method of allowing \\nthe model to offer a much richer volatility structure, is to make it into a two-factor model. \\nTwo-Factor Short-Rate  Models  \\nThe two-factor Hull–White  model results from adding a second process to the model as \\ndescribed above (see Hull, 2003). Consider the model dynamics \\nd f (r  (t)) =[θ (t ) +u −α(t) f (r (t))]dt +σ1(t )dW1(t) \\ndu =− bu dt +σ2(t)dW2(t ) \\nwhere the function  f generalizes the Hull–White model, allowing the above process to rep-\\nresent a function  of the short rate, giving greater calibration potential. The additional factor u \\nis itself a mean-reverting process with a long-run mean of zero (it also has an initial value of \\nzero). \\nAs such,  instead  of taking the volatility of the short rate to be stochastic, the authors have \\nallowed for a more elaborate drift term. This part of the equation controls how the yield curve is \\ncaptured and it allows for a rich set of shapes to be calibrated with much less time dependence \\nthan the one-factor case. Additionally, closed form prices for bonds exist in the two-factor \\ncase, making calibration quick. /parenrightbigg Appendix B \\nApproximations \\nB.1 APPROXIMATIONS FOR V ANILLA PRICES AND GREEKS \\nIn section 5.9 of Chapter 5 concerning the Greeks, we saw some approximations that can be \\nused for quick mental computation of prices and Greeks. Here we give their derivations. \\nFirstly, we need to approximate the Normal probability density function φ(x), which is also \\nreferred to as the derivative of the Normal CDF N /prime(x) \\n2 \\n2 φ(x) =√ 1e−x\\n2π \\n1 /parenleftbigg x2 \\n=√ 1 − +··· \\n2π 2 \\nwhich is just  a standard Taylor series expansion of the exponential function. The Vega of both √ \\ncall and\\n put options under Black–Scholes is given by V = SN /prime(d1) T. In the case where √ \\nthe option  is  ATM, d1 reduces to d1 = σ T/2, and the Vega of the ATM vanillas can be \\napproximated, using  the above formula, as \\n√ \\nVega = S  TN /prime(d1) \\n= S √\\n \\nT 1 √ \\n2\\nπ /parenleftbigg \\n1 −\\n d2 \\n1 \\n2 +··· /parenrightbigg \\n=\\n S √\\n \\nT 1 √ 2\\nπ /parenleftbigg \\n1 −\\n σ 2t \\n8 +··· /parenrightbigg \\n(B.1)  \\nIf we take only  the  zeroth order of this series expansion we get \\n√ \\nST Vega ATM ≈√ \\n2π \\nThe price  of  an ATM call option can then be approximated knowing that the ATM call is linear \\nin volatility (no Vega convexity, assuming zero rates). We get \\n√ \\nSσ T  Call ATM ≈√ \\n2π \\nThe price  of  the call option can alternatively be approximated directly from the Black–Scholes \\nformula \\n−rT N (d2) C = SN  (d1) − Ke\\nand approximating  the  Normal CDF N (x). The result for the approximation of the call option’s \\nprice can be found in the literature in Brenner and Subrahmanyam (1988). /integraldisplay \\n/integraldisplay /parenrightbigg \\n/parenrightbigg \\n/parenleftbigg 350 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nWe now approximate the Normal CDF to use below. Starting from the deﬁnition of the \\nNormal CDF and using the above approximations based on Taylor series of the exponential, \\nplus some tricks regarding the CDF, we get \\nx 2 \\n2 N (x ) =√ 1e−sds \\n2π −∞ \\n1 /integraldisplay 0 /integraldisplay \\n2 x 2 −s\\n2 2 =√ e ds +√ 1e−sds \\n2π −∞ 2π 0 \\nx1 1 /parenleftbigg s2 \\n= +√ 1 − +··· ds 2 2π 0 2 \\n1 1 /parenleftbigg x3 \\n= +√ x − +··· 2 2π 6 \\nThe closer  x  is to zero, the more accurate this approximation. If rates are zero, and the call is \\nstruck ATM, then substituting this approximation for the CDFs into Black–Scholes gives the \\nsame zeroth-order approximation to the price of the call option as above. To make both these √ \\nmore computable  in the head, we note that the fraction 1/ 2π is approximately equal to 0.4. \\nMoving on, the  Delta of a call option is given by N (d1) under Black–Scholes, and we \\napproximate this also using the above formula. \\n/Delta1 = N  (d1) \\n1 1  = +√ (d1 +··· )2 2π \\n1 d1≈ +√ 2 2π \\n≈ 0.5 +0.4d 1 \\nwhere we have just plugged d1 into the above approximation of N (x ), and taken this expansion √ \\nto the zeroth  order only. We already know that the d1 of an ATM option is given by σ T /2,√ \\nso the zeroth-order approximation  to  the Delta of an ATM option is 0.5 +0.2 ×σ T . \\nThe approximation\\n for Gamma also follows from similar approximations: \\nN /prime(d1)Gamma =√ \\nSσ T  \\n=√ 1 √ 1 −  d12 \\n+··· /parenrightbigg \\n2π Sσ T  2 \\n1 ≈√ √  \\n2π Sσ T  \\n0.4 ≈√ \\nSσ T  /radicaltp /radicalvertex /summationdisplay /summationdisplay \\n/summationdisplay /productdisplay \\n/bracketleftBigg /bracketrightBigg /summationdisplay \\n/bracketleftBigg /parenleftBigg /parenrightBigg/bracketrightBigg /summationdisplay \\n/bracketrightbig \\n/bracketrightbig 351 Appendix B: Approximations \\nB.2 BASKET PRICE APPR OXIMATION \\nThe approximate formula used for portfolio variance, and also to approximate the volatility of \\na basket, is given by \\n/radicalvertex n n \\nσB = /radicalbt wi w j σi σ j ρi, j \\ni=1 j=1 \\nwhere the sums are over all assets in the basket/portfolio. Assuming log-normality of the \\nunderlying assets, this formula is not exact. It follows from the approximation that \\nn n \\nSwiB = wiSi ≈ i \\ni=1 i=1  \\nwhere the basket, deﬁned as a sum of assets, is approximated by a product. See De Weert \\n(2008). \\nA consequence  is  that if we assume zero rates as dividends, then the price of the call option \\non the basket is given by \\nCB = B(0) N (d1) − K N (d2) \\nwhere d1 and d2 are given by the usual formulas now using σB for the volatility term, and in \\nall places B (0) = w1 S1(0) + w2 S2(0) replaces the spot S in the Black–Scholes formula. \\nB.3 ICBC/CBC INEQUALITY \\nIn section 9.2.2 we saw the inequality \\nICBC payoff < CBC payoff \\nwhere \\n1 N \\nICBC payoff = max 0, min (Perf i , Cap) N i =1 \\n1 N \\nCBC payoff = max 0, min Perf i , CapN i =1 \\nNot to complicate things, let’s do this for the case of two assets, although it can be proved for \\ngeneral N . For two assets we have \\n/bracketleftbig 1 /bracketrightbig1ICBC payoff = max 0, 2 min (Perf 1, Cap) + 2 min (Perf 2, Cap) \\n= 1 max /bracketleftbig \\n0, min (Perf 1, Cap) + min (Perf 2, Cap) 2 /bracketleftbig /parenleftbig 1 /parenrightbig/bracketrightbig1CBC payoff = max 0, min 2(Perf 1, Cap) + 2(Perf 2, Cap) \\n1 /bracketleftbig \\n= 2 max 0, min (Perf 1 + Perf 2, 2Cap ) \\nso essentially we only  need  to compare \\nmin(Perf 1, Cap) + min(Perf 2, Cap) /bracketleftbigg /bracketrightbigg \\n/bracketleftbigg /bracketrightbigg \\n/bracketleftbigg \\n/parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg 352 Exotic Options and Hybrids \\nand \\nmin (Perf 1 + Perf 2,2Cap ) \\nAn analysis  of  the only four possible outcomes, Perf 1 > C and Perf 2 > C, Perf 1 > C and \\nPerf 2 < C, Perf 1 < C and Perf 2 > C, Perf 1 < C and Perf 2 < C, shows that in each case \\nmin (Perf 1,Cap) + min (Perf 2,Cap) ≤ min (Perf 1 + Perf 2,2Cap ) \\nso the result holds. \\nB.4 DIGITALS: VEGA AND THE  POSITION OF THE FORW ARD \\nThe goal of this section is to derive a formula that allows for a speedy mental check for the \\nseller of a digital to assess whether they are long or short volatility based on the position of \\nthe forward. \\nWe know that  the price of a digital is given by the limit of a call spread. Under Black–Scholes \\nthe digital call’s price is given by D(K ) = N (d2), which is essentially the derivative of the \\nBlack–Scholes formula for a European call option w.r.t. the strike of the option. Firstly, we \\nwrite d2 in terms of the forward F \\nln (F/K )  − σ2t/2 d2 = √ \\nσ T \\nnow write  N (d2) as its deﬁnition as a CDF: \\n2 \\n2 N (d2) =√ 1 /integraldisplay d2\\ne− x \\n2π −∞ \\nThen the Vega of a digital is given by the derivative of this integral w.r.t. the volatility σ: \\n2 ∂D(K ) ∂ 1 /integraldisplay d2 \\n− x \\n2 = √ e∂σ ∂σ 2 π −∞ \\nd2 ∂d2 =√ 1e− 22 × \\n2π ∂σ \\nd2 − ln(F/K ) − σ2t/2 /bracketrightbigg \\n2 =√ 1e− 2 × √ \\n2π σ2 t \\nwhere moving to  the second equality we used the fact that only d2 depends on σ.T h e l a s t \\nequality involves simply computing the derivative of d2 given above by the volatility σ. \\nSo, in essence,  the Vega of the digital is positive (i.e. the seller of the digital is short volatility) \\nonly if \\nF σ2t − ln −  > 0 K 2 \\nbecause\\n all the other terms are positive. For this to be satisﬁed we need \\nF < K  × e−σ2 t/2 353 Appendix B: Approximations \\nfor reasonable volatility σ and time to maturity t the term σ 2t /2 is small and the exponential \\ncan be approximated as a series giving the inequality \\n/parenleftbigg σ 2t /parenrightbigg \\nF <\\n K × 1 − 2 \\nThe opposite  holds  in that if \\n/parenleftbigg σ 2t /parenrightbigg \\nF >\\n K × 1 − 2 \\nthen the above digital Vega will be negative and the seller of the digital is long volatility. \\nSo, as a  ﬁrst check, if the forward F is greater than the strike K then the second inequality \\nis immediately satisﬁed and the seller is long volatility. An equality (instead of either of these \\ninequalities) refers to the case where the seller is ﬂat on volatility. This approximate inequality \\nserves as a good mental check for the seller of a digital to see if they are long or short volatility.

These chapters allow us to draw on many of the points made earlier in the book \\nregarding correlation, dispersion and volatility, and provide a transparent insight into the world \\nof hybrid derivatives. The ﬁrst two of the four chapters on hybrids discuss the key asset classes: \\ninterest rates, commodities, foreign exchange, inﬂation and credit. For each asset class we look \\nat the markets individually and gain insight into the nature of each, the various underlyings, \\nvanilla instruments, skews and smiles and a brief look at some popular exotics in each.
